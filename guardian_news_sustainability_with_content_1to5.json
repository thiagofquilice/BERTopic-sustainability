But outdoor adventuring can be surprisingly challenging to navigate with a light tread.</p> <p>Even if you are mindful of your car mileage and tent site selection, the chemicals that go into the manufacture of camping gear can have long-term impacts on the planet. With <a href=\"https://www.tra.gov.au/en/domestic/caravan-and-camping-data\">record numbers of Australians</a> keen to commune with nature, here are some ways to reduce your impact.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/11/e-bike-buying-guide-australia-best-tips-change-by-degrees-brands-features\">When two wheels are better than four: a buyer\u2019s guide to ebikes</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Travel light</h2> <p>Small is good, says Lee Atkinson, travel writer and author of Ultimate Road Trips Australia. \u201cOpt for a tent or a camper trailer that you can power with a solar blanket or panels rather than a big motorhome or caravan with lots of appliances.\u201d</p> <p>Not only will you save on fuel and power, Atkinson says, \u201cbut if you have a small off-road trailer, you\u2019ll also be able to go places that you can\u2019t get to in a big rig, like national parks\u201d.</p> <h2>Leave no trace</h2> <p>Eschewing a vehicle altogether and travelling on foot is, of course, a lower-impact option \u2013 but off-grid camping brings with it a whole other set of personal responsibilities.</p> <p>\u201cIt requires planning and commitment to self-sufficiency,\u201d says Caro Ryan, who runs a <a href=\"https://lotsafreshair.com/\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/rescued-an-outdoor-podcast-for-hikers-and-adventurers/id1681010405\">podcast</a> on hiking and adventuring. Ryan advises learning about local flora to avoid sensitive vegetation when setting up camp.</p> <p>\u201cLook for more robust surfaces such as rock and packed earth,\u201d she says, to minimise disturbance and erosion.</p> <p>Detergents and soaps are a no-go when wild camping \u2013 with Ryan also recommending against those labelled \u201cbiodegradable\u201d or \u201ceco-safe,\u201d which only break down in soil, not water. Instead, she recommends washing up with boiled hot water and grit, \u201cwhether a bit of sand or gravel.\u201d Discard food scraps and used washing up water away from the watercourse.</p> <p>Personal hygiene pretty much follows the same process as washing up, with a light and quick-drying \u201cChux\u201d being Ryan\u2019s washcloth of choice. If you decide to bathe in a creek or river, be aware that soap, insect repellent or sunscreen can pollute the water \u2013 as can toothpaste.</p> <p>\u201cAnd of course, take all rubbish with you, including your poo!\u201d Ryan says.

When it comes to buying, there are a few tips you can use to minimise your impact as best you can.</p> <ul> <li><p>Buy good quality gear that will last a long time.</p></li> <li><p>Look for the sustainability statements of manufacturers, and whether they offer repair options and post-life recycling programs to stop products going to landfill. Some will also sell secondhand products back to the public.</p></li> <li><p>Find out if they\u2019re using recycled or virgin plastics in their gear, where they\u2019re sourced from and how they\u2019re waterproofed.</p></li> <li><p>Look out for certifications from organisations such as bluesign\u00ae, Oeko-Tex, GOTS and the Responsible Down Standard (RDS).</p></li> </ul> <p>If you do invest and buy, don\u2019t discard it if something breaks or it isn\u2019t right for your next adventure, says Ryan. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to repairs zippers in packs, or burst holes in puffer jackets or fix tents,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/04/never-fly-again-go-vegan-it-was-too-hard-but-i-still-cut-my-emissions-by-61-and-it-made-life-simpler-and-better\">Never fly again?

    "content": "<p>It is a time for rest and indulgence for many, but one that often leads to unnecessary waste. The Soil Association, the UK\u2019s biggest organic lobbying group, estimates that 5m puddings, 2m turkeys and 74m mince pies are binned every year.</p> <p>So how can we have a more sustainable holiday? By being aware of what we are buying, says Conor Spacey,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/oct/02/from-root-to-tip-how-to-stop-food-waste-and-save\" title=\"\"> the author of <em>Wasted</em></a>, a cookbook based on using all parts of any given ingredient.</p> <p>\u201cChristmas is traditionally a feast holiday, but having a more sustainable one doesn\u2019t mean we have to eat less \u2013 it\u2019s more about being conscious of what we eat,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>Buying and budgeting</h2> <p>Planning ahead means that you will avoid unnecessary spending and waste from the Christmas dinner, as well as any other food you may be tempted to buy, thanks to the lure of supermarket end-of-aisle offers.</p> <p>So make a list and stick to it. This means understanding how much food people are likely to eat.</p> <p>For a turkey dinner, of course this can vary according to appetite but according to Dominique Woolf, a chef and author, as a guide you will need about 400g of turkey per person if buying a crown, and 500g if it\u2019s a whole bird.</p> <p>Jassy Davis of online grocer Abel &amp; Cole says: \u201cYou probably need a smaller turkey than you think. Between 150g and 200g of cooked turkey is normally enough for most people. That means a leg will serve two; a 2.5kg crown, four to six; and a small 4.5kg turkey, eight.\u201d</p> <p>Buying meat on the bone means you will be able to use it for stock afterwards, says David Lagonell, chef director at the Temper chain of restaurants. Local butchers should be the first port of call, he says. \u201cUnfortunately, supermarkets don\u2019t always have sustainability at the forefront of what they sell, especially at this time of year when the sheer volume doesn\u2019t allow it.</p> <p>\u201cBut the power of decision remains with us. I\u2019d much rather buy really good poultry, than mediocre beef for the same price.\u201d</p> <p>Vegetables typically used for Christmas dinner \u2013 carrots, parsnips, onions, celery and sprouts \u2013 are all in season and should be bought to support growers, says Spacey.</p> <p>\u201cBuying loose vegetables ensures that you cut down on plastic and that you only buy what you need. More waste can often be caused by buying vegetables that are already packed in plastic, and contain more than you want, meaning that you have to find other ways to use them.\u201d</p> <p>Davis says about 250g of potatoes per person is enough, and 80g each of other vegetables, such as sprouts, carrots, cabbage and parsnips.</p> <h2>Choose the right storage</h2> <p>Storing food before and after it is cooked dictates how long it lasts and prevents waste. Spacey says root vegetables and tomatoes are best stored outside the fridge at room temperature, as are exotic fruits such as melons, pineapples and bananas.</p> <p>Most items from the dinner can be frozen afterwards, including turkey, cranberry sauce and cooked vegetables, as well as cake and chocolates (if there are any left), says Woolf.</p> <p>Some cheeses can also be put in the freezer, such as hard and semi-hard ones, although soft ones don\u2019t fare well. Emma Young, author of <em>The Cheese Wheel</em>, says using wax or greaseproof paper is the best way to wrap cheeses in the fridge. If using plastic containers, store similar cheeses together. If you put a Stilton with a cheddar, the moulds will jump from one to the other. If you do see mould, simply trim it away.</p> <h2>Using up leftovers</h2> <p>The Boxing Day turkey curry is almost as much part of Christmas as the turkey itself, but it does not have to be. Groups and chefs pushing sustainability have numerous suggestions on what to do with leftovers.</p> <p>The Soil Association has <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/take-action/organic-living/organic-recipes/?tag=Christmas+-+Zero+Waste\" title=\"\">a series of zero-waste recipes</a>, including brussels sprout sauerkraut, turkey and cranberry pie and sweetcorn and turkey chowder.</p> <p>Spacey says the offcuts from vegetables can be deep fried and made into crisps. He adds: \u201cOuter brussels sprout leaves make a wonderful, earthy, pesto. Simply place them into boiling water for 30 seconds, then refresh under cold water. Squeeze dry and add equal quantities of the leaves with basil to a blender.</p> <p>\u201cAdd toasted nuts and Parmesan, and blend, slowly adding rapeseed oil and salt and pepper until it becomes a paste.\u201d</p> <p>Davis says it is important to plan the meals around Christmas Day, such as what you will eat on 27 December, so that the extra is used up rather than \u201choping you\u2019ll find a time to use them up\u201d.</p> <h2>Wine \u2026 a weighty issue</h2> <p>The glass bottles in which wine is stored have been pinpointed as the main reason behind the industry\u2019s carbon footprint \u2013 from how they are made to the transport demands of shipping them around the world.</p> <p>The Sustainable Wine Roundtable, a collaboration by groups in the wine trade, has recommended that retail members should reduce the average weight of bottles from 550g to 420g by the end of 2026.</p> <p>Naked Wines, which signed the \u201cbottle weight accord\u201d, says: \u201cFor years there has been a myth that a heavy glass wine bottle means it must be high quality. This simply isn\u2019t true.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the most highly regarded wines in the world don\u2019t have them. But because the myth continues, brands continue to use them to appeal to consumers who may not be aware that it\u2019s a myth, or of the resulting impact on the environment. Heavy bottles are often seen at times of celebration.\u201d</p> <p>For consumers who want to buy lighter, the only existing test at the moment is simply to pick up a bottle and compare it with another one. Heavier glass may have some embossing on it, and occasionally, more progressive makers put the weight on the packaging.</p>"

It must be peace lasting for days, years, generations. We therefore support a ceasefire, but only if it is sustainable.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe know many in the region and beyond have been calling for an immediate ceasefire. We recognise what motivates these heartfelt calls.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is an understandable reaction to such intense suffering, and we share the view that this conflict cannot drag on and on. That is why we supported the recent humanitarian pauses.\u201d It came after it emerged that three <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/15/israeli-military-says-its-troops-shot-and-killed-three-hostages-by-mistake\" title=\"\">Israeli hostages killed by the Israel Defence Forces </a>in Gaza were bare chested and carrying a white flag when they were shot, according to an initial military investigation.</p> \n<p>Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told a press conference late Saturday that they were as \u201ccommitted as ever\u201d to war. He said they were determined to fight to the end and Gaza \u201cwill be demilitarised and under Israeli security control following the defeat of Hamas\u201d.</p> \n<p>The killing of the three hostages \u2013 who were kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October during its assault on southern Israel \u2013 has triggered widespread anger and incredulity in Israel amid a mounting sense of anxiety over the safety of the remaining hostages in Gaza.</p> \n<p>According to reports of the IDF probe in the Israeli media, the three men Yotam Haim, Samer El-Talalka and Alon Shamriz \u2013 all in their 20s \u2013 had somehow escaped their captors and were approaching an IDF position in the Shejaiya area of Gaza City where there has been heavy fighting.</p> \n<p>One of the men was carrying a stick with a white cloth tied to it and all had removed their shirts. Spotting the three, an Israeli soldier on a rooftop opened fire, shouting \u201cTerrorists!\u201d</p> \n<p>While two of the hostages fell to the ground immediately, the third fled into a nearby building. When a commander arrived on the scene, the unit was ordered into the building where soldiers killed the third hostage despite his pleas for help in Hebrew.</p> \n<p>As the first details of the killing were released by the IDF on Friday night, after most Israelis had begun to mark Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, a hastily called demonstration converged on the Kirya, a military headquarters compound in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Chanting \u201cShame\u201d, \u201cThere\u2019s no time\u201d and \u201cDeal now!\u201d the protesters represent a growing thread of anger in Israel at the way in which the war is being prosecuted, as the situation of the remaining hostages in Gaza has taken a series of dark of turns in the past week. After the brief optimism of the last ceasefire, news for the hostage families has been grim.</p> \n<p>A series of bleak and perfunctory announcements from the IDF and other officials have disclosed the deaths of a number of hostages, including one, Sahar Baruch, killed during a failed rescue attempt.</p> \n<p>The killing of the three hostages came hard on the heels of the military\u2019s announcement that it recovered the bodies of three other hostages killed by Hamas, after Israel had suggested that it believes about 20 of more than 130 hostages still held in the densely populated coastal strip are dead.</p> \n<p>The mistaken killing by the IDF of the three men has amplified an already bubbling sense of anger that has cut across Israel\u2019s political affiliations over the Netanyahu government\u2019s handling of the hostage crisis, which critics say has blown hot and cold over the weeks of war prompting recriminations.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf Israel can\u2019t protect its citizens, why does it exist?\u201d demanded demonstrator Ben Aviv, a camera focus puller, echoing a question that has troubled Israelis since 7 October. \u201cIt is obvious this situation is not going to be resolved by military action.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d added Jonathan Porat, an economist, \u201cbecause this is what I would want people to do for me if I was in the hostages\u2019 position. I don\u2019t believe the [military] operation is going the way it\u2019s being suggested. I want the hostages back. I was a soldier. We don\u2019t leave anyone behind.\u201d</p> \n<p>And it is not only at gatherings such as this where the question of where Israel\u2019s war against Hamas is going \u2013 and to what meaningful end \u2013 is being asked.</p> \n<p>Cameron and Baerbock write in an article, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-cameron-gaza-ceasefire-israel-palestine-war-s50x2kscw\">published in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-cameron-gaza-ceasefire-israel-palestine-war-s50x2kscw\">The Sunday Times</a> </em>and <em>Welt am Sonntag</em> in Germany, \u201cIsrael will not win this war if their operations destroy the prospect of peaceful coexistence with Palestinians. They have a right to eliminate the threat posed by Hamas. But too many civilians have been killed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Following Biden\u2019s comments last week that Israel was losing international support because of its \u201cindiscriminate bombing\u201d, US officials have told Israel that its window for conducting major combat operations in Gaza is fast closing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/09/netanyahu-rejected-ceasefire-for-hostages-deal-in-gaza-sources-say\">Netanyahu rejected ceasefire-for-hostages deal in Gaza, sources say</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The reality is that the events of the past few days, around the question of the hostages and on the diplomatic stage, have cast a light on a key unresolved tension at the heart of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas over its war aims: how to dismantle the threat of Hamas in Gaza while securing the release of those captured.</p> \n<p>And while Israeli officials have tried to suggest it was the intense military pressure on Hamas that led to last month\u2019s ceasefire and hostage deal, the hostage deaths have led to mounting questions over that strategy.</p> \n<p>The intersection of these two competing war aims was underlined by comments made a week ago by Israel\u2019s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi. Asked what would Israel do if it located Hamas\u2019s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, surrounded by hostages, Hanegbi\u2019s answer infuriated hostage families. \u201cThat would be a heart-rending dilemma,\u201d Hanegbi answered.</p> \n<p>It was a disquiet amplified by reports later in the week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/14/israeli-ministers-block-mossad-heads-effort-to-restart-gaza-hostage-talks\" title=\"\">Netanyahu had blocked David Barnea,</a> the head of Israel\u2019s foreign intelligence service, the Mossad, from travelling to Qatar to kickstart negotiations, expressed in a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe feeling is that every evening, a [game of] Russian roulette is being played in which families are being notified of their children\u2019s deaths in captivity.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Palestinians in Gaza, the continuing trajectory of Israel\u2019s two-month long offensive is writ large in terms of daily deaths and suffering, amid mounting hunger and disease.</p> \n<p>With the death toll \u2013 civilian and combatant \u2013 now almost 19,000 according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the coastal strip, whole neighbourhoods have been reduced largely to rubble and 1.8 million of the strip\u2019s population of 2.3 million internally displaced.</p> \n<p>All of which has fuelled an escalating humanitarian crisis that has been driving the wider international discomfort, not least in Washington. Even as Israeli officials insisted they need further months to complete their campaign against Hamas, the message from Biden was clear.</p> \n<p>Discussions, said a US official after the meeting, were focused on \u201ca shift in emphasis from high-tempo, high-intensity clearance operations to ultimately lower-intensity focus on high-value targets, intelligence-driven raids, and those sorts of more narrow, surgical military objectives.\u201d</p> \n<p>While US officials have said in public they do not wish to impose a timeline, privately it is clear that the Biden administration is pushing for an end to major combat operations by the end of December.</p> \n<p>Also unsettling the White House has been Netanyahu\u2019s refusal to discuss meaningful ideas for the \u201cday after\u201d \u2013 who will govern Gaza and how and the scope for reconstruction amid the public rejection by the Israeli prime minister of the idea that a reinvigorated Palestinian Authority, which governs in the West Bank, should be involved.</p> \n<p>Despite the bellicose language of Netanyahu insisting the war will go on for as long as Israel deems necessary for \u201cabsolute victory\u201d, there is a sense that the clock is ticking down.</p> \n<p>And while Netanyahu has tried to make political capital out of his public show of defiance of Biden, it is not a stance that has met with approval from the Israeli public.</p> \n<p>In one sign, however, that Netanyahu may be softening his position, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported on Saturday that the Mossad chief had travelled to Oslo at the weekend to meet Qatari officials about the shape of a new ceasefire-for-hostages deal.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, however, there was little sign that the war might be heading towards a less intensive phase or a second ceasefire.</p> \n<p>Palestinian media reported that at least 14 people were killed in strikes that hit two houses on Old Gaza Street in Jabalia, while dozens more were reported killed in a strike that hit another home in the same area.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery day, I leave the place where we took refuge,\u201d said Israa Zahr, a doctor working in an Unrwa shelter who survived an Israeli airstrike on her home that killed her mother, brother and nephew.</p> \n<p>\u201cI say goodbye to them when I go to work as if it were the last farewell. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t come back. I\u2019m afraid I will come back and I will find no one.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a282813-cb5c-419f-8314-fd357b386160\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0olDJ_UCFf4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

One said it will \u201cpush\u201d the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization to host \u201cpositive livestock content\u201d at Cop28. The Guardian recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/20/ex-officials-at-un-farming-fao-say-work-on-methane-emissions-was-censored\">revealed</a> that pressure from the industry led to censorship of FAO reports on the role of cattle in increasing greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Animal agriculture is the largest emitter of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide when measured over a 20-year period. Scientists said that unless swift action is taken, methane from agriculture alone will push the world <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/06/meat-dairy-rice-high-methane-food-production-bust-climate-target-study\">beyond</a> a 1.5C (2.7F) rise in temperature above preindustrial levels that risks tipping the world into irreversible climate breakdown.</p> <p>\u201cThese companies are stepping up their game because the exposure they are facing is stepping up,\u201d says Jennifer Jacquet, professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami. \u201cIt used to be that they were caught on the back foot, but now they\u2019re completely prepared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny credible action to reduce emissions in the food sector will inevitably lead to a reduction in the total volume of meat and dairy products produced,\u201d says Nusa Urbancic, CEO of campaign group the Changing Markets Foundation. \u201cThe industry is terrified of that and has been deploying multiple tactics to delay the inevitable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a036c8edc3beb644a9c3f07f4337f482e965f8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a036c8edc3beb644a9c3f07f4337f482e965f8f/174_0_5115_3070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ranchers load feed pens for cattle on a farm in Maraba, Brazil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ranchers load feed pens for cattle on a farm in Maraba, Brazil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The meat sector\u2019s largest emitters plan to be on the ground at Cop28 in large numbers, the documents show. At Cop27, JBS, the world\u2019s most polluting meat company, <a href=\"https://www.desmog.com/2022/11/18/big-agribusiness-delegates-double-cop27/\">gained</a> access to talks because it came as part of Brazil\u2019s national delegation. <br></p> <p>Companies at the summit will be accompanied by lobby groups that represent them, some of which have a history of obstructive action. They include the <a href=\"https://desmog.com/north-american-meat-institute\">North American Meat Institute</a> (Nami), which represents large meat producers in the US and which in 2022 was still <a href=\"https://www.desmog.com/2022/10/06/aim4c-climate-science-denial/\">questioning </a>on its website whether climate change was caused by humans.</p> <p>While the leaked documents are aimed at the meat sector, they also show that dairy companies are planning on sending a \u201clarge delegation\u201d to Cop28.</p> <p>Earlier this year, backlash from several countries with interests in meat led to the <a href=\"https://qz.com/ipcc-report-on-climate-change-meat-industry-1850261179\">watering</a> down of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s<strong> </strong>recommendations on diets.</p> <p>Companies and trade groups are told in the documents that one of the ways to \u201chave the most influence\u201d is to \u201cequip delegates with your key messages and solutions\u201d, a list of which are provided in the pack.</p> <p>The files also detail collaborations planned for the event itself, with meat lobbying groups hosting events at country pavilions, including those of the US and Australia.</p> <p>Australia and the US are the <a href=\"https://beef2live.com/story-world-beef-exports-ranking-countries-0-106903\">second</a> and third largest beef exporters globally after Brazil, and their governments have a strong economic interest in supporting the growth of these industries, as well as close political ties with them. </p> <p>Researchers said government support is a significant factor in determining the continued power of the animal agriculture industry over alternatives. A <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/one-earth/pdfExtended/S2590-3322(23)00347-0\">study</a> this year found that in the EU, meat and dairy farmers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/18/gigantic-power-of-meat-industry-blocking-green-alternatives-study-finds#:~:text=The%20analysis%20of%20lobbying%2C%20subsidies,800%20times%20more%20public%20funding.\">received 1,200 times more public funding than new alternative protein sources</a>, while in the US, they received 800 times more support.</p> <p>Jacquet said addressing the cosy relationship between governments and industry was crucial to changing diets to align with climate goals.</p> <p>\u201cTypically, the talk is about demand-side interventions, like you can get schools or individuals to give up meat,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m a little worried that some of this [meat] production is so baked into subsidies and policy, that even with decreased demand, this apparatus will just keep flowing.\u201d </p> <p>In the documents, trade groups also reveal their plans to influence non-country pavilions via sponsorship, which can cost between $10,000 and $200,000. This is championed as a way to host sessions and bring guests along to receptions.<strong><br><br></strong>The documents also include a messaging summary with key talking points that present meat as \u201csustainable nutrition\u201d and suggest that meat production can be beneficial to the environment.</p> <p>In a four-page set of arguments, the Global Meat Alliance claims that producers can \u201cplay a key role in environmentally sustainable food systems\u201d and that the sector is \u201ccontinuously driving towards carbon-friendly farming\u201d.<br><br>Several of these arguments reference the idea that grazing livestock can help maintain healthy soils, which can store carbon. This is often described as \u201cregenerative agriculture\u201d. It is a favoured line with many food companies, despite the fact that scientists have <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-023-00876-x#Sec34\">said</a> that soils are not a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/soil-revolution-climate-change/619611/\">reliable</a> way to store carbon in the long term, and that removals can be easily undone.</p> <p>In its messaging, the industry also heavily references the role of meat in relieving hunger in the global south, claiming that it \u201cplays a key role in reducing food insecurity and malnutrition\u201d. However, the UN-linked Committee on World Food Security has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/cfs/Docs2021/VGFSyN/CFS_VGFSyN_TwoPager_web_EN.pdf\">pointed</a> out that hunger and malnutrition are not caused by a lack of food, pointing instead to problems with access, distribution and power.</p> <p>Meat eating worldwide is very unequal. Europeans eat more than twice the global average, and consumption levels in north America and Australia are even higher. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0594-0.epdf\">One 2018 study</a> found western countries would have to reduce their meat intake by 90% to limit global heating to acceptable levels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3324e4610a9a9ad1e4c31688e55f2f205503402\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3324e4610a9a9ad1e4c31688e55f2f205503402/0_0_5574_3344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional bagels with hot salt beef prepared in a bakery in Bethnal Green, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traditional bagels with hot salt beef prepared in a bakery in Bethnal Green, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paolo Paradiso/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The documents make passing reference to cutting methane, and encourage participation in events where this is discussed. This is despite the fact that emissions from beef production globally <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/6-pressing-questions-about-beef-and-climate-change-answered\">are roughly equal</a> to the emissions of the entire nation of India, with science <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/here-s-what-eat-save-yourself-planet-less-meat-more-n959556\">pointing to</a> a shift in diets as the one surefire way to cut emissions.<br><br>The Food4Climate pavilion, which aims to promote plant-based food, is labelled in the documents as \u201cextreme\u201d, which also show displeasure at <a href=\"https://www.cop28.com/en/news/2023/11/COP28-to-offer-15C-aligned-menus-across-more-than-90-culinary-outlets\">the Cop28 presidency\u2019s choice of a mostly vegan menu</a>.</p> <p>While the Global Meat Alliance presents itself as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatAlliance\">supporting</a> an \u201caligned global meat sector\u201d the group\u2019s membership is skewed heavily toward producers in the global north.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.globalmeatalliance.org/our-partners\">Fourteen</a> of the group\u2019s 16 partners come from the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand or North America. The remaining two partners are global lobby groups representing large companies and multiple countries.</p> <p>This follows a wider trend in multi-stakeholder climate initiatives, where smallholder groups are sidelined. A recent report found that small-scale farmers, who produce a third of the world\u2019s food, receive just 1% of climate finance.</p> <p>A GMA spokesperson said: \u201cThe GMA is an international networking group with an aim to support a better connected, aligned global meat sector by providing industry with accumulated insights, best practice, and collaboration opportunities to address shared challenges such as sustainability in the pre-competitive space. This includes visibility on intergovernmental events which are often dominated by an anti-meat narrative. GMA works to simplify and distil public information around these events, which is largely complex, to ensure industry understand how and where to engage, having equal opportunity to be heard.\u201d</p> <p>Livestock experts with a focus on the global south have repeatedly stressed the importance of including a range of perspectives in discussions of livestock pollution. Ian Scoones, a researcher at the Institute of Development Studies, said: \u201cMy big fear in all of this debate is that the likes of pastoralists who we work with around the world will get stuffed because they don\u2019t have a voice.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Cop28: Can fossil fuel companies transition to clean energy?<br>On Tuesday 5 December, 8pm-9.15pm GMT, join Damian Carrington, Christiana Figueres, Tessa Khan and Mike Coffin for a livestreamed discussion on whether fossil fuel companies can transition to clean energy.

The finances indicate we need to diversify our income streams; to find a way to be sustainable.</p> <p>\u201cThe dependency on ECB is significantly greater for what you might call non-Hundred venues and around 85% of that ECB funding isn\u2019t linked to inflation. In real terms, it\u2019s worth roughly \u00a3750,000 less in 2024 than back in 2020.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the ECB\u2019s fault, but it says we need to take control of our destiny, rather than waiting for someone else to find a solution.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29eee0dbf517e053a3073956504bebe5ae95ecf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29eee0dbf517e053a3073956504bebe5ae95ecf8/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spectators shelter under umbrellas at the County Ground as rain halts play during England\u2019s ODI against Ireland on 26 September 2023. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rain and drainage issues led to England\u2019s ODI against Ireland at the County Ground on 26 September 2023 being abandoned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That non-Hundred status is something the club would like to address well in advance of any move, with the club expected to push hard for a franchise should the ECB expand the tournament to 10 teams from 2025 onwards. Somerset would be rivals for a spot in the south-west, while Durham want to host a north-east side.</p> <p>Brown said: \u201cBristol and the south-west have suffered as a result of not having a direct link to the Hundred. We still stand by the fact that Bristol and Nevil Road meet the things that the ECB wanted at the time and say are still important.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fastest growing city outside London, hugely diverse and with young families \u2013 the heart of what they want to do. And while we know we can do a very good job right now at Nevil Road, we want to do an outstanding job in 10 years\u2019 time.\u201d</p> <p>Moving out of Bristol to a potential site near the M4 would appear to affect the club\u2019s accessibility but Brown expects the city\u2019s broader expansion \u2013 and the resulting infrastructure \u2013 to see it in effect become an urban venue.</p> <p>As signatories to the United Nation\u2019s Sports for Climate Action Framework and its <a href=\"https://www.gloscricket.co.uk/sustainability/\">pledge to reach net zero by 2040</a> \u2013 plus having led the way for English cricket in recent times with a number of green initiatives \u2013 the club say they would aim to make environmental considerations central to the new venue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b167a2730f0d41cf71a9a60561c8736bd86ca931\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b167a2730f0d41cf71a9a60561c8736bd86ca931/0_28_1381_1726/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Pietersen celebrates victory after scoring 91 not out as England beat Australia in a one-day international at the County Ground, Bristol, in 2005\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Pietersen celebrates victory after scoring 91 not out as England beat Australia in a one-day international at the County Ground, Bristol, in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brown said: \u201cClimate change is the single biggest issue.

And though the idea predates last year\u2019s \u00a3570,000 loss and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/26/englands-summer-reaches-farcical-end-with-odi-against-ireland-washed-out-cricket\">washed-out ODI against Ireland</a> in September that highlighted the ground\u2019s shortcomings, both have sharpened the resolve.</p> <p>Brown added: \u201cThat ODI [against Ireland] goes to the heart of it; the last Tuesday in September against, with all due respect, lower-ranked opposition. Had we got New Zealand on a Sunday two weeks earlier, the difference might have been \u00a3400,000 in revenue. We get one England match a summer and it\u2019s still our major payday.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to de-risk so our dependance on one single day isn\u2019t so great. And we want to get more, two, maybe three men\u2019s internationals, more women\u2019s internationals, plus the Hundred \u2013 or whatever the competition is in future.\u201d</p>"

I know, I\u2019m like the level of plastic particles in our waters: unprecedented. But it\u2019s my sartorially fastidious partner, Claire, who does the laundry while my duties include walking the dog, cooking, cleaning, shopping, birthing babies, wiping bums \u2026 all of which casts a spectrum of stains across my wardrobe. So when I\u2019m challenged to wash my clothes less \u2013 which is one of the small ways we can individually reduce the aforementioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/08/plastic-particles-oceans-marine-pollution-production\">microplastics entering the ocean</a> \u2013 the first thing that happens is a row with my partner over the sensitive question of whether I can claim to \u201cwash less\u201d considering the small matter of not actually doing any washing at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"adb716725971384043922c8a3002ea29b3bdb8c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adb716725971384043922c8a3002ea29b3bdb8c4/1106_0_4480_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chitra Ramaswamy in Leith with her dog Daphne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Messy business \u2026 Chitra Ramaswamy walking her dog Daphne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, I can aim to put less in the laundry basket. I begin by carrying a microfibre cloth everywhere I go, ready to stab at stains as soon as they appear, Lady Macbeth style. I highly recommend it as a domestic war weapon. But does it lighten the laundry load? It does! It turns out an entire medium-sized Uniqlo lamb\u2019s wool jumper does not need to be washed if I drop toothpaste on it. I just cloak my index finger in microfibre cloth, dampen with cold water, dab and go. I spot-clean jumpers, jeans, trousers, and shirts for a month and look no more dishevelled than usual. Result!</p> <p>As for deciding when to put stuff in the wash, my general rule is if it hasn\u2019t directly touched a body part, don\u2019t bother. I end up putting less clothes in the wash even if it means spending an inordinate amount of time sniffing the armpits and crotches of my garments. It reminds me of when I used to see mums lifting up their babies in public to smell their bums and thinking \u201cgood God, never!\u201d How little we know ourselves, in the end.</p> <p>When we do put a wash on, we use a three-hour eco-cycle \u2013 the machine uses less water and a lower temperature \u2013 and I don\u2019t notice the difference. I have also picked up other life hacks: wearing an apron when cooking, tucking trousers into socks when I\u2019m walking the dog, hanging clothes on the line to air them on blowy days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f19b08502797daa1f099771d41b58df1562c5350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f19b08502797daa1f099771d41b58df1562c5350/0_255_6233_3742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chitra Ramaswamy holding a stack of folded clothes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chitra and her spotless clothes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My children, meanwhile, continue to chuck their clothes in the basket, by which I mean to the floor, every five minutes.

High street knits aren\u2019t known for robustness and then there are those thieves of cosy joy: clothes moths. An inventory reveals seven of my woollies have holes; one black jumper is practically a colander and my favourite stripy Uniqlo knit is more hole than sleeve. I\u2019m desperate to fix it and the others need some TLC to remain wearable. What can I do?</p> <p>Thankfully I\u2019m asking myself this at the right moment: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jun/19/mending-much-more-than-making-do-london-exhibition\">mending movement</a> is huge and visible darning is part of that. Some visible mends sit on the frontier of art and craft: textile artists such as <a href=\"http://celiapym.com/\">Celia Pym</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hikaru_noguchi_design/\">Hikaru Noguchi</a> explore the beauty of repair in their work and the stories it tells about our relationship with clothes. For beginners, YouTube is packed with helpful how-to videos; there are also <a href=\"https://www.collingwoodnorrisdesign.com/visible-mending?category=Kits\">kits</a>, <a href=\"https://sew-fabulous.org/product/mending-skills-darning-workshop-2023/\">workshops</a> and Zoom tutorials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b4175f0d92b21930d273cbf0cdafbbc9b6e1c9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b4175f0d92b21930d273cbf0cdafbbc9b6e1c9a/0_1177_3655_3651/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Visible mending with creative embroidery by Flora Collingwood-Norris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visible mending with creative embroidery by Flora Collingwood-Norris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rose+Julien Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I go one better and ask <a href=\"https://www.janemercer-feltartist.com/\">Jane Mercer, a textile artist</a> who volunteers at the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-64600939\">Groves Repair and Share</a> cafe in York, to show me the ropes. We start simple, on a practice square of fabric, as Mercer explains how to gradually build a lattice of threads across the hole with a tapestry needle and wool. I have no sewing skills \u2013 I barely manage buttons \u2013 but this is easy to understand, plus the visible mending technique of using contrasting colours makes it easier to see what you\u2019re doing. My darn is wonky, but I get it done.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"757405abc69f0e402437823a3eba7de7fa99bad7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/757405abc69f0e402437823a3eba7de7fa99bad7/0_755_2252_2811/801.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Beddington showing her mended stripy top sleeve. \" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Beddington showing her mended stripy top sleeve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Buoyed up by this success, I buy some pale blue wool to tackle a modest hole in a grey jumper. It takes me hours; I unpick my work multiple times and get frustrated with my own ineptitude, but the end result is definitely wearable.</p> <p>Before tackling my Uniqlo sleeve \u2013 the Everest of mends for a novice \u2013 I ask knitwear designer and visible mending expert <a href=\"https://www.collingwoodnorrisdesign.com/visible-mending\">Flora Collingwood-Norris</a> for advice. She thinks a darn should work and I shouldn\u2019t be intimidated by the scale: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing radically different about big holes. They just look scarier and take longer.\u201d What really lets me lose my fear, though, is when she says: \u201cAs soon as it becomes visible mending, there aren\u2019t any rules you\u2019ve got to stick to. By making it visible, you\u2019re telling people that you decided it was going to look like that, so all you have to do is wear it with intention.\u201d</p> <p>That feels so freeing \u2013 permission to be a bit rubbish \u2013 so I get stuck in. It takes me three sessions, the red wool I have picked is extremely uncooperative, but I end up with something I\u2019m not totally ashamed of. My mend is what Collingwood-Norris calls \u201can impressionist painting\u201d (OK, from a distance and chaotic close up) but who except me will know? I\u2019ve extended the life of two jumpers in just a few hours and gained a real sense of possibility: I can do this and I will again.</p> <p><strong>Emma Beddington</strong></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I was surprised at how much was lurking in the rails\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Unfortunately, I\u2019m colour-blind. Blues and purples, reds and greens, oranges and browns \u2013 and much in between \u2013 all merge into one. This means that ever since I could dress myself, I have acquired a number of questionable looks. My teens saw me in the neon-glow of Topman nu rave, then there was a foray into flannel, a brief stint in Hawaiian shirts, trousers that were far too skinny, and finally my current style, which is a lot of the same thing: jeans with oxford shirts.</p> <p>I have done a few culls of my wardrobe over the years and sent old items for recycling or to charity, but somehow it always remains full. It wasn\u2019t until completing a \u201cwardrobe audit\u201d that I realised how unchanging and wasteful I am.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f7ca2f75b0c4c08b35afec8934b3b198f11f9ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f7ca2f75b0c4c08b35afec8934b3b198f11f9ef/313_483_2711_3386/801.jpg\" alt=\"Ammar Kalia trying out new looks after auditing his wardrobe.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ammar Kalia trying out a new look after auditing his wardrobe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years, apps such as Whering and Indyx have sprung up to help us work with what we already have rather than constantly being drawn to new purchases. You take a photo of each item in your wardrobe and the apps use them to create a digital catalogue that helps you work out which items you wear most and what to do with those you put on least.</p> <p>Taking a photo of all of your clothes is laborious. But I was surprised at how much was lurking in the rails: a butter cream silk shirt that I can only assume I got for fancy dress, thermal leggings and half a dozen formal white shirts.</p> <p>After three weeks I ventured into my \u201cstats\u201d. I found that I wore the same four button-down shirts 80% of the time, while two pairs of jeans made up 90% of my bottom-half choices. After reading some <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/wardrobe-audit\">wardrobe audit advice</a>, I began trying on my least worn outfits to decide whether I should keep them, sell them, or send them off to charity. This was followed by a questionable trip to the supermarket in a pair of baggy white jeans, a video meeting in silk, and a gig in pink linen.</p> <p>Surprisingly, wearing these rediscovered clothes didn\u2019t make me feel like an eyesore \u2013 if anything, it made me want to inject more colour and variation into my wardrobe, even if I don\u2019t always get the combinations right. I might have stood out from the crowd but maybe that\u2019s OK \u2013 it\u2019s better than dressing like Mark Zuckerberg, trapped in a uniform of efficiency and boredom.</p> <p>After a month of wardrobe auditing, it was the staples such as the endless white shirts that I decided to send to charity so I can make space for the clothes I previouslylackedthe confidence to wear. There is worth in wearing and adapting what we already have, to make sure our changes in style don\u2019t always mean new purchases. When we do buy, we can look sparingly, for something unique. In my case, however, one silk shirt is probably enough.</p> <p><strong>Ammar Kalia</strong></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019m keen to see if I can recoup some of the money I spent\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Here\u2019s the thing: I have too many clothes. Not too many outfits to choose from \u2013 rather I have a small selection of clothes that I actually wear and a wardrobe\u2019s worth that I haven\u2019t looked at in years. I am aware that this is entirely a problem of my own making \u2013 and a privileged one at that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4330e0d22e3adae7a0af01c1060789861239dae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4330e0d22e3adae7a0af01c1060789861239dae/0_60_8000_4799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leah Harper posing with some of the clothes she put up for sale on Vinted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leah Harper posing with some of the clothes she put up for sale on Vinted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has become what I call my \u201ceBay backlog\u201d: items I have kept, intending to sell, for decades<em> </em>now. These aren\u2019t beautifully crafted, investment pieces that I always planned to keep for ever: regrettably (but predictably) they are student-budget-friendly fast fashion, mixed with grungy vintage \u201cgems\u201d and non-refundable secondhand purchases that never really fit me. I could just donate them all to charity \u2013 but I\u2019m keen to see if I can recoup some of the money I spent first.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"54323d3264cb560f05f8207693851384363c0658\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54323d3264cb560f05f8207693851384363c0658/0_456_6000_7495/801.jpg\" alt=\"Leah Harper posing with some of her clothes for sale on Vinted.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The challenge, of course, is to not buy as much as you sell\u2019 \u2026 Leah Harper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Vinted app has been a gamechanger for selling clothes. Similar to other resale sites, you take photos of the items, write a quick description and upload \u2013 but it\u2019s quicker and simpler to use than other places like eBay. Even so, my backlog has remained. I would set aside entire days to list everything, but invariably find myself distracted by other things. Perhaps, then, the key would be to tackle my secondhand heap drip by drip, pledging to list one item a day to avoid feeling overwhelmed. It started well: I\u2019m a sucker for routine and settled into a dinner-telly-Vinted groove. The mountain began to appear less insurmountable and items started to sell. Vinted tracks your cumulative balance and, as app-induced dopamine hits go, it could be worse.</p> <p>But, occasionally, I do like to go out or go away and that meant I got behind on my selling. So I turned to a third-party seller to help me. <a href=\"https://www.stae.store/\">Stae</a> is a secondhand store that sells on your behalf in return for a cut of the profits. I offered founder Jenna 10 items and she agreed to take half; that\u2019s five days \u201coff\u201d. </p> <p>It all helps. Slowly, the hoard dwindles. Long-ignored clothes are parcelled up and posted to new homes. The challenge, of course, is to not buy as much as you sell; Vinted is a den of temptation for anyone with an eye for a fashion bargain. But in terms of shifting to a more sustainable way of shopping, it still feels like a good habit to develop.</p> <p><strong>Leah Harper</strong></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018This is the appeal of going to a tailor: altering clothes to be bespoke, so that they are a pleasure to wear\u2019</strong></h2> <p>When it comes to clothes, I find people tend to be minimalists or maximalists. This was apparent to me while growing up, when my younger sister had an ever-expanding wardrobe of high-street purchases, the majority of which she didn\u2019t seem to wear. I, meanwhile, have always found shopping to be more stressful than rewarding.</p> <p>I don\u2019t hang on to clothes out of sentiment \u2013 not least because of space restrictions \u2013 and bestow those I will never wear again to the local charity shop. But I do have clothes that linger largely unworn because they don\u2019t fit or they need fixing and I don\u2019t have the skills to do it. I currently have a pair of white linen trousers that sit too low on the waist for my liking; a silk shirt with the button missing from one cuff; and a Cos pea coat bought new with five buttons, none of which remain.</p> <p>I suppose I\u2019ve been put off visiting my local tailor by the imagined expense of repairing items and that I am clearly getting along well enough without by wearing jeans and a T-shirt on repeat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af5a89d5e1e47bd166571c56736faa7d70a995ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af5a89d5e1e47bd166571c56736faa7d70a995ec/0_364_6214_3729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Overhead shot of tailor measuring fabric with a tape, in a sewing spot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is no doubt that now, in fitting me precisely, they look more expensive than they were\u2019 \u2026 Elle Hunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cavan Images/Getty Images/Cavan Images RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, finally, I bag the clothes up and take them to the tailor. The man behind the counter is brisk and efficient. I put on the trousers and show him how much higher I would like the waist to be. He puts the pins in the appropriate places, then suggests another amendment to the legs, just below the seat. It\u2019s not something that would have occurred to me, but even just held in place by pins, I can see that he is absolutely right: it brings together the trousers\u2019 new fit, making them coherent as a high-waisted style. This, I realise, is the appeal of going to a tailor: altering clothes to be bespoke, so that they are a pleasure to wear.</p> <p>In the weeks that follow, I receive compliments on the linen trousers that I never did before \u2013 chiefly, of course, because I never used to wear them. But there is no doubt that now, in fitting me precisely, they look more expensive than they were. Yes, at about \u00a335, the cost of having them altered was nearly as much as I paid for them in the first place. But now that they are back in rotation, I see that my apprehensions were rooted in a false economy: there is no item of clothing more costly, to the environment or your bank balance, than the one you never wear.</p> <p><strong>Elle Hunt</strong></p>"

The flight, partly funded by the UK government, flew to great fanfare from airlines and ministers as a potentially guilt-free way to fly. However, scientists and environmental groups are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/28/scientists-uk-aviation-net-zero-ambitions-half-farmland-double-renewable-electricity\">more sceptical</a>.</p> <p>The climate charity Possible and the law firm Leigh Day have filed formal complaints against the two major airlines over their claims about reducing emissions from flights. </p> <p>The senior campaigner at Possible, Alethea Warrington, said: \u201cThe reality is that technologies for cleaner flight either don\u2019t work, or don\u2019t even exist yet. We think that airlines\u2019 misleading claims about their emissions are unfair on people who want to do the right thing when they travel. It\u2019s time for airlines to start being honest about their sky-high emissions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/26/can-uks-jet-zero-hopes-take-off-with-a-plane-fuelled-by-used-cooking-oil\">Can UK\u2019s \u2018jet zero\u2019 hopes take off with a plane fuelled by used cooking oil?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The complaints, filed under the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/corporate/mne/\">National Contact point mechanism</a> run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), set out that both airlines are misleading consumers over their claims on reducing carbon emissions from flights as the layperson does not have the expertise to discern the limits of decarbonisation technology.</p> <p>Airlines claim they can use biofuels made from crops or green hydrogen made from renewable energy, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/28/scientists-uk-aviation-net-zero-ambitions-half-farmland-double-renewable-electricity\">recent research from the Royal Society</a> has found the UK would have to devote half its farmland or more than double its total renewable electricity supply to make enough aviation fuel to meet its ambitions for net zero flying.</p> <p>The filing highlights that BA claims to be \u201cdriving urgent action towards net-zero emissions\u201d and that it says it has a \u201cclear roadmap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050\u201d. However, analysis has found BA\u2019s emissions from jet fuel <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-7894425/Flying-BA-increase-emissions-46-passenger-compared-rival-airlines-claims.html\">have increased</a> year-on-year between 2016 and 2019.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic features its \u201cmission to net zero\u201d on its promotional materials but fails to mention it is falling short of its emissions targets, which Possible has argued is crucial information for consumers.</p> <p>The charity also points out scientific literature comparing the lifecycle emissions from biofuels with conventional jet fuel, \u201cwhich is clear that these fuels may produce even more emissions and be worse for the climate than kerosene\u201d. Both feedstocks produce fuels with similar tailpipe emissions to kerosene, and the emissions reductions are claimed to be created at a systemic level.</p> <p>\u201cFor fuels derived from biomass, land is not available to produce crops for biofuels in sufficient quantities to power aviation without causing hugely damaging deforestation, which increase emissions and makes biofuels just as bad for the climate as kerosene, if not worse,\u201d the charity said.</p> <p>A British Airways spokesperson said: \u201cIn 2019, we committed to net-zero emissions by 2050 and, while there is no single solution to this challenge, as part of our BA Better World programme, we have a clear roadmap of initiatives to get there.</p> <p>\u201cIn the short-term, this means improving our operational efficiency, investing in new, more fuel-efficient aircraft and progressively introducing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) with partnerships in the UK and US, while for the medium to longer term, we\u2019re continuing to invest in the development of SAF \u2013 a critical path to decarbonise, and looking at how we can help with the growth of zero-emissions hydrogen-powered aircraft and carbon-removal technology.</p> <p>\u201cWe were the first airline to report our carbon footprint more than two decades ago and were the first airline to voluntarily participate in the UK emissions trading scheme.\u201d</p> <p>A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: \u201cAt Virgin Atlantic, we are committed to achieving net zero 2050 and have set interim targets on our pathway to get there, including 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.</p> <p>\u201cThere are two levers for delivering in-sector carbon reductions in the short to medium term: the fleet we operate and fuel we burn. We already fly one of the youngest and most efficient fleets across the Atlantic. Beyond fleet renewals, SAF presents an immediate opportunity to deliver lifecycle carbon reductions of up to 70% and is something we have been pioneering for over 15 years.\u201d</p>"

    "content": "<p>Amid the horror of the last seven weeks, recent days have brought some degree of relief for many in Israel and Gaza. Hostages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/29/coffee-and-a-never-ending-hug-at-return-of-mother-abducted-by-hamas\">released by Hamas</a> are deeply traumatised by their ordeal; many will face fresh despair as they learn that their friends and loved ones are dead, or as they attempt to come to terms with leaving fathers and husbands in captivity. Inhabitants of Gaza <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/28/deaths-from-disease-in-gaza-could-outstrip-deaths-from-war-un-says\">remain homeless, hungry, desperate, grieving and terrified</a> by the prospect of death soon raining down upon them once more. And yet the ceasefire and releases have brought a faint glimmer of limited hope when previously there has seemed to be none.</p> <p>Qatar said on Wednesday afternoon that it was \u201cvery optimistic\u201d that the ceasefire will be lengthened further. Hamas said it was willing to back a four-day extension, and Israeli officials indicated that it had enough hostages to cover two to three days more of releases, with an estimated total of 161 hostages held captive in Gaza. For Hamas, this time has allowed it to regroup, while the release of jailed Palestinians has boosted its support. However, almost as many Palestinians have been arrested as freed since the truce went into effect, including children, <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-11-29/israel-intensifies-its-attacks-in-the-west-bank-as-it-negotiates-a-new-extension-of-the-gaza-truce.html\">according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club</a>. For Benjamin Netanyahu, the pause has indicated recognition of US concerns and addressed the fury of those lambasting the Israeli prime minister for not prioritising hostages.</p> <p>Prospects of extending the ceasefire beyond the weekend look a great deal bleaker. Future releases will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/28/hostage-talks-show-a-battered-hamas-is-far-from-down-and-out\">harder to negotiate</a>. Hamas will seek to extract a far higher price for those remaining, overwhelmingly men, than it did for women and children, particularly when it comes to soldiers. The Palestinian prisoners proposed for release will not only be women and children, but men, some of whom may have committed serious crimes. Mr Netanyahu, knowing that his political survival is tied to the continuance of this conflict, said in a video statement on Wednesday that he was \u201cunequivocal\u201d that the country would return to fighting, adding: \u201cThere is no situation in which we do not go back to fighting until the end.\u201d</p> <p>No one suggests that it is easy for Israel to remove those who wreaked the horrors of 7 October. But its tactics to date have shown very limited success against Hamas, at unbearable civilian cost. The Israel Defense Forces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/26/idf-messaging-suggests-gaza-truce-unlikely-to-last-much-beyond-tuesday\">estimate</a> that they have killed between 1,000 and 2,000 Hamas fighters in the assault on Gaza. That is a fraction of its 30,000 or so total, and a tiny number set beside the total Palestinian death toll of about 15,000, almost half of them children, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/26/can-we-trust-casualty-figures-from-the-hamas-run-gaza-health-ministry\">Gaza\u2019s health ministry</a>, under Hamas control. With domestic political pressure growing, the Biden administration has made it clear that it opposes Israel extending that kind of campaign to the south, targeting people in the place it ordered them to flee to. With almost 2&nbsp;million people packed into a smaller area, an even higher death toll might well result.</p> <p>Yet it is not hard to conceive of an Israeli offensive which, if not the all-out assault waged on northern Gaza, is still far from being a carefully targeted surgical strategy. Without an enduring ceasefire materialising, violence might fade only slowly and uncertainly. But there may be a few precious days left in which to advance towards a meaningful political process to end these hostilities. The last few days have shown that progress is possible. The last few weeks have shown that the alternative should be unthinkable.</p>"

The Virgin Atlantic founder and president, Sir Richard Branson, also onboard, said: \u201cThe world will always assume something can\u2019t be done, until you do it.\u201d</p> <p>Airlines see SAF as a critical route to cutting net emissions, because it can be used in existing planes. However, the availability of the fuel now is less than one-thousandth of the total volume of jet fuel used worldwide.</p> <p>Shai Weiss, the Virgin Atlantic chief executive, said SAF was \u201cthe only viable solution for decarbonising long-haul aviation. It\u2019s taken radical collaboration to get here and we\u2019re proud to have reached this important milestone, but we need to push further.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s simply not enough SAF and it\u2019s clear that in order to reach production at scale, we need to see significantly more investment. This will only happen when regulatory certainty and price support mechanisms, backed by government, are in place. Flight 100 proves that if you make it, we\u2019ll fly it.\u201d</p> <p>Harper said the government would \u201ccontinue to support the UK\u2019s emerging SAF industry as it creates jobs, grows the economy and gets us to \u2018jet zero\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Five commercial plants to produce SAF in the UK are due to be under construction by 2025. The fuel used on Tuesday was imported from the US and EU.</p> <p>The flight comes after a year of testing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/28/rolls-royce-sell-electric-flight-division-jet-engines-tufan-erginbilgic\">the engine maker Rolls-Royce</a> and other industry partners. Scientists onboard VS100 will assess the flight\u2019s non-carbon emissions, including contrails and particulates, whose effect on global warming is not fully understood but is believed to be significant.</p> <p>Campaigners said the government and airlines were making misleading claims for the flight \u2013 particularly a Department for Transport announcement that SAFs would \u201cmake guilt-free flying a reality\u201d.</p> <p>Cait Hewitt, the policy director of the Aviation Environment Federation, said: \u201cThe idea that this flight somehow gets us closer to guilt-free flying is a joke.\u201d</p> <p>She said SAF production would be very hard to scale up sustainably, adding: \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll have better technological solutions in future but, for now, the only way to cut CO<sub>2</sub> from aviation is to fly less.\u201d</p> <p>Progress worldwide is likely to be slow. Last week nations at the UN\u2019s aviation agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization, agreed at a summit in Dubai to \u201cstrive to achieve\u201d a target of reducing the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of jet fuel burnt by 5% by 2030.</p>"

    "content": "<p>The Ukrainian government is planning to change its conscription practices as it seeks to sustain fighting capacity after nearly two years of full-fledged war with Russia.</p> <p>The changes, expected to be announced this week, will include the use of commercial recruitment companies to carry out more targeted conscription and to reassure conscripts they will be deployed in roles that match their skills and not simply sent to the front, according to one senior official.</p> <p>\u201cSome people are scared, scared to die, scared to shoot, but it doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be involved in other activities \u2026 Now we have a new minister with a new approach,\u201d Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s security council, told the Guardian.</p> <p>In early September, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/03/volodymyr-zelenskiy-sacks-defence-minister-and-lines-up-replacement\">sacked Oleksii Reznikov</a>, who had been defence minister since the beginning of the war, and replaced him with Rustem Umerov, who spent the early part of the war working on doomed negotiations with Russia. On Friday, Zelenskiy said he expected Umerov\u2019s ministry to provide him with a package of new mobilisation policies this week.</p> <p>\u201cThe plan will be worked out and all the answers will be there \u2013 next week I will see this plan,\u201d Zelenskiy told a news conference, without giving further details.</p> <p>Danilov said the army would work with two of Ukraine\u2019s biggest recruitment companies in order to identify people with specific skills, and to dissuade skilled Ukrainians who wanted to help the army but did not want to go to the front from trying to evade the draft.</p> <p>\u201cThe mobilisation will become more flexible, those specialities that are required will be announced, and people will be volunteering for a concrete position. For example, they need welders or mechanics and so on,\u201d said Danilov.</p> <p>A source in the defence ministry confirmed that contracts had been signed with recruitment companies, but did not give any further details. It was not immediately clear how involved the recruitment companies would be in the process, nor at what level general recruitment for frontline work would continue alongside the more targeted process.</p> <p>Zelenskiy\u2019s announcement comes as Ukraine prepares to face another winter at war, with widespread fatigue at the front and amid society at large. The summer and autumn Ukrainian counteroffensive has failed to win back large amounts of territory, and there are increasing voices among Ukraine\u2019s western partners suggesting in private that sooner or later Kyiv may need to consider attempting a negotiated end to the war.</p> <p>In the first months of the war, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians volunteered to fight, as part of a wave of patriotic determination that shocked Russia and repelled its initial advances. But as the war has dragged on, most people who are willing to fight have already signed up, and many of those already at the front are injured or exhausted.</p> <p>Increasingly, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/15/bribes-and-hiding-at-home-the-ukrainian-men-trying-to-avoid-conscription\">army has had to turn to mobilisation to fill the ranks</a>. Viral videos have shown men snatched from the street to be conscripted, and there have been numerous corruption scandals of officials taking bribes to provide exemption. In August, Zelenskiy fired every regional recruitment chief.</p> <p>Once conscripted, recruits get a few weeks of training and can then be sent to the front. Many Ukrainians say if called upon they would go to the army, but many men of conscription age who do not want to be sent to the front have spent weeks or months hiding at home, trying to avoid the roaming squads of mobilisation officers. Many join Telegram groups in which people share tips on where mobilisation officers are working on any given day.</p> <p>In the summer, sources in Odesa explained a popular scheme in the city, whereby for a fee of $5,000 in cash, men who did not want to serve could receive a fake medical report suggesting serious spinal issues, with which they would be declared exempt from conscription and be allowed to leave the country.</p> <p>Danilov admitted there was a recruitment issue but said Russian propaganda was exaggerating the scale of the problem. \u201cRussia is trying to heat up this issue, saying that we don\u2019t have enough soldiers, that we have problems with mobilisation \u2026 There are always problems in life, let\u2019s not overestimate it,\u201d he said.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Keir Starmer has joined Rishi Sunak in calling for a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, as the political rhetoric continues to shift away from unqualified support for Israel\u2019s assault in line with moves from the US and others.</p> <p>Some senior Conservatives were even more explicit. Ben Wallace, a former defence secretary, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/18/israel-killing-rage-fuel-conflict-50-years-warns-ex-uk-defence-secretary-ben-wallace\">Israel\u2019s \u201ckilling rage\u201d risked it losing international support</a>, and Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, said she believed Israel had broken international humanitarian law.</p> <p>The Labour leader said there was a need \u201cto get to a sustainable ceasefire as quickly as possible\u201d, beginning with a pause in the fighting during which the remaining hostages seized by Hamas on 7 October can be freed and aid can enter Gaza.</p> <p>\u201cIt will have to be a political process, to a two-stage solution which, in the end, is the only way that this is going to be resolved,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The prime minister earlier said Israel had a right to defend itself following Hamas\u2019s massacre of Israeli civilians, but \u201cit must do that in accordance with humanitarian law\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that too many civilian lives have been lost and nobody wants to see this conflict go on a day longer than it has to,\u201d Sunak said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been consistent \u2013 and I made this point in parliament last week \u2013 in calling for a sustainable ceasefire, whereby hostages are released, rockets stopped being fired into Israel by Hamas and we continue to get more aid in.\u201d</p> <p>Asked to elaborate on the meaning of a sustainable ceasefire, Sunak\u2019s official spokesperson said it did not mean a demand for Israel to stop its assault on Gaza immediately.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire, hoping it somehow becomes permanent, is is the way forward. We need the right conditions to ensure that it lasts as long as possible,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asked if the prime minister agreed with Wallace\u2019s comments, made <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/12/17/netanyahus-tactics-are-weakening-israel/\">in an article</a> for the Daily Telegraph, however, the spokesperson did not reject the former defence secretary\u2019s view.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned, as we have set out before, that too many civilians are being killed in Gaza and that their vital infrastructure is being destroyed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In a strongly worded article, Wallace said he agreed with Israel\u2019s right to self-defence but that this did not come without limits: \u201cGoing after Hamas is legitimate, obliterating vast swathes of Gaza is not. Using proportionate force is legal, but collective punishment and forced movement of civilians is not.\u201d</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was at fault for missing warnings about the Hamas attack, Wallace wrote: \u201cBut if he thinks a killing rage will rectify matters, then he is very wrong. His methods will not solve this problem. In fact, I believe his tactics will fuel the conflict for another 50 years.\u201d</p> <p>Kearns echoed the point, speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One: \u201cHamas is an ideology which recruits into its membership. Bombs don\u2019t obliterate an ideology and neither can a stable state be constructed from oblivion.\u201d</p>"

    "content": "<p>Fozia Ismail has clear memories of being summoned to the living room where the rest of her family sat on the floor huddled around a cassette player. When her mum pressed play, the voice of relatives in Somalia filled their north London flat. \u201cI had to listen to people that I hadn\u2019t met: uncles and aunties, and then record an awkward message back,\u201d says Ismail, whose family comes from Somaliland, a region that later became autonomous.</p> <p>In the 1980s and early 1990s, before mobile phones, letter tapes were one of the main forms of communication between Somalis in the diaspora and their families back home.</p> <p>Fast-forward 40 years, and Ismail, a Bristol-based artist and the co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.dhaqan.org/\">Dhaqan Collective</a>, is celebrating the legacy of letter tapes through Camel Meat and Cassette Tapes, an art and research project. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a5d131f0c49ad4a7753eac80ddf6fcdd117a8ad3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5d131f0c49ad4a7753eac80ddf6fcdd117a8ad3/557_0_4458_3603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cassette player and tape on a small round table\" width=\"1000\" height=\"808\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dhaqan Collective is celebrating the legacy of letter tapes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Samuel White/Dhaqan Collective</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The project began in 2019 with a series of workshops that brought together 14 Bristol-based Somali elders and 10 British-born Somalis, who discussed the cultural and personal significance of the letter tapes.</p> <p>\u201cIt facilitated conversations that [young people] had never really had with their parents, aunts or grandparents. They ended up finding out so much about them,\u201d says artist and Dhaqan Collective co-founder, Ayan Cilmi.</p> <p>\u201c[In one conversation a mother] shares this heartbreaking story about this special tape with the voice of her cousin who has since passed, and how she still goes back and listens to it. So she thought it was wonderful that her son now understands why tapes were so significant,\u201d adds Ismail.</p> <p>Through the workshops and with the help of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/waaberiphone/\">Waaberi Phone</a>, an online archival platform centred on preserving Somali art and culture, Ismail and Cilmi gathered conversations and recordings of music and poetry. </p> <p>\u201cThere was a story about a woman whose husband divorced her via letter tape,\u201d says Ismail. \u201cThere were love letters, advice for those who had gone to Europe, and a lot of praying for the health of the family, as well as chit-chat, gossip about weddings, funerals.\u201d</p> <p>Many old tapes went beyond family news, they were also deeply political, used as means of communication within the Somali National Movement to start a revolution against the military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, who later <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03064229008534923\">subjected the tapes to strict controls</a>. </p> <p>In 1988, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/13/world/over-300000-somalis-fleeing-civil-war-cross-into-ethiopia.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap\">Siad Barre launched vicious airstrikes in Hargeisa</a>. During the chaos, broadcasters at Radio Hargeisa grabbed thousands of cassette tapes containing what is known as Somalia\u2019s golden age of music (1960s to the 1980s) and buried them in a secret underground bunker, hoping they would survive. Incredibly they did.</p> <p>Today, the Hargeisa Cultural Centre houses the largest Somali cassette archive, and has been instrumental in preserving and digitising them.</p> <p>Ostinato Records, a New York-based record label specialising in music from Africa and the diaspora, has also digitised a large number of the tapes, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/8/18/uncovering-somalias-forgotten-music-of-the-1970s\">producing a CD of 15 songs in 2017</a> \u2013 which was nominated for a Grammy.</p> <p>Somali people have a rich oral history: stories, poetry, histories, myths and songs were passed down through generations by word of mouth. It is no surprise, says Ismail, that Somalis adopted the cassette tape as a form of documentation and communication.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d58461e8ed97c18deb80a61b84f63d9cc5c76fe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d58461e8ed97c18deb80a61b84f63d9cc5c76fe5/0_321_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of Somali people sit in a circle around a cassette player on a table in the centre of a darkened room \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Somalis gather to listen to letter tapes as part of the Camel Meat and Cassettes Tapes project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Samuel White/Dhaqan Collective</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Somali civil war caused mass displacement and a refugee crisis, tapes took on a new relevance. Not only were they used as a means of staying in touch with relatives back home, but they maintained a crucial link to their cultural heritage and sense of self, while navigating environments away from family and friends.</p> <p>Ismail and Cilmi hope to generate a similar sense of belonging with Camel Meat and Cassette Tapes.</p> <p>The pair<em> </em>are now exploring the recording of nomadic weaving songs, a traditional practice under threat because the climate crisis is destroying the natural materials used in weaving.</p> <p>Environmental instability has added a sense of urgency to their work.</p> <p>\u201cAll of our projects relate to climate change in that Somali people are being displaced internally,\u201d says Ismail. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t really thinking about preserving the culture out there, they are thinking about surviving and about being displaced.\u201d</p> <p>They are also determined to move beyond one-dimensional narratives of violence and trauma, to show the breadth of Somali culture \u2013 its humour, joy and creativity.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like there is so much humour in Somali culture,\u201d says Ismail, laughing at the memory of one weaving song where a woman sings \u201cyou haven\u2019t given us the snacks bitch. We\u2019ve been weaving for you but you haven\u2019t prepared the snacks.\u201d</p> <p>Ismail adds: \u201cWe\u2019re using material to ignite a conversation, and to make space for playing around and laughing together.\u201d</p>"

H&amp;M, for instance, <a href=\"https://about.hm.com/news/general-news-2019/on-the-way-towards-using-100--sustainable-materials.html\">plans</a> to use only <a href=\"https://about.hm.com/news/general-news-2019/on-the-way-towards-using-100--sustainable-materials.html\">sustainably sourced materials</a> by 2030.

One prominent example is US-based influencer Reese Blutstein, who is known to her 353,000 followers on Instagram for her \u201csustainable wardrobe\u201d, highlighting vintage clothing and repeat outfits. For years, she has <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/04/230543/sustainable-fashion-influencers#slide-5\">spoken</a> to various publications about sustainability and the need to wear what we already have and increase scrutiny around fast fashion practices. However, she has done several collaborations with some of fast fashion\u2019s biggest players, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/fast-fashion-giant-inditex-unveils-new-sustainability-targets-2023-07-11/\">such as Zara</a>, and has written a lengthy, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvhBDgYDRMu/\">worthy message</a> about her intention to help make the brand more sustainable in the long run, saying \u201cit was never my intention to be a voice of public social commentary\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/05/shop-workers-tiktok-stars-home-spun-video-clips\">\u2018People believe people like themselves\u2019: meet the shop-floor TikTok stars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others are more subtle. Anna Newton, better known by her handle @theannaedit, blogs about a minimalist approach to fashion, championing a capsule wardrobe and only buying what you need, or what you will wear again and again. However, alongside advertising for <a href=\"https://directory.goodonyou.eco/brand/arket\">fast</a> <a href=\"https://goodonyou.eco/how-ethical-is-sezane/\">fashion</a> brands such as <a href=\"https://www.theannaedit.com/the-arket-essentials-that-i-wear-all-year-long/\">Arket</a> <a href=\"https://www.theannaedit.com/why-sezanes-newest-drop-makes-for-the-perfect-capsule-wardrobe-ad/\">and S\u00e9zane</a>, framing their clothing as capsule wardrobe-friendly, Newton <a href=\"https://www.theannaedit.com/annas-edit-the-best-of-the-2023-cyber-week-sales/\">puts together</a> mammoth round-ups of almost entirely fast fashion items full of affiliate links (paying her a commission). This particular type of eco-adjacent influencing is extremely common. Monikh Dale (365,000 followers) similarly takes this <a href=\"https://monikh.com/2019/06/wardrobe-detoxing.html\">sustainably minimalist</a> approach to fashion, encouraging her followers to practise greener shopping and to avoid fast fashion while <a href=\"https://monikh.com/2023/11/sunday16-15.html\">making money</a> out of affiliate links to clothing from brands such as &amp; Other Stories and H&amp;M, and <a href=\"https://corq.studio/insights/campaigns-uk-monikh-dale-styles-mangos-circular-denim-collection-to-highlight-importance-of-sustainable-fashion/\">collaborating</a> on \u201csustainable\u201d lines from fast fashion brands and retailers including Mango. Any time spent on these corners of TikTok and Instagram will reveal an endless string of influencers doing this performative bait-and-switch, collectively reaching tens of millions of followers.</p> <p>Some of this is in service of fast fashion brands created by influencers themselves. The most obvious example is Tala, owned by the influencer and entrepreneur Grace Beverley (more than a million followers). Originally offering a limited line of leggings, sports bras and tops, the brand now sells a variety of loungewear, outerwear, accessories and athletic clothing that is said to be made of mostly recycled and \u201cnatural\u201d materials, made ethically by properly paid workers. Beverley, as the founder, promotes the brand heavily to her million-plus followers on Instagram and TikTok, alongside promoting her own green lifestyle.</p> <p>On the surface, this sounds all well and good. But a closer look shows something rather less green. This autumn, Tala launched several new product lines, one of which sold a million pounds\u2019 worth of stock <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy3PM42M0Fc/\">in a day</a>, moving more than 6,000 units (this pace of new releases is not unusual). It has partnered with fast fashion companies, selling its clothes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/01/asos-fast-fashion\">through Asos</a> and doing a dedicated collaboration with <a href=\"https://directory.goodonyou.eco/brand/fila\">Fila</a>. Its products are also only partly made of recycled materials, and often recycled polyester \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/mar/22/how-green-are-your-leggings-recycled-polyester-is-not-a-silver-bullet-yet\">sustainability</a> of which environmental campaigners are keen to emphasise is limited.</p> <p>The independent ethical shopping site <a href=\"https://directory.goodonyou.eco/brand/tala\">Good On You</a> gave Tala an overall sustainability score of 3 out of 5, which it characterised as \u201ca start\u201d in terms of the company\u2019s sustainability efforts. Not the worst offender, but hardly the fastidious approach to sustainability you would expect, given its green marketing \u2013 an approach <em>actually</em> taken by companies such as <a href=\"https://directory.goodonyou.eco/brand/organic-basics\">Organic Basics</a> or <a href=\"https://directory.goodonyou.eco/brand/girlfriend-collective\">Girlfriend Collective</a>, which appear to back up their green claims. Tala\u2019s website notes that it is simply trying to make some more sustainable choices, and that sustainability is a \u201cjourney; not an end destination\u201d.</p> <p>A similarly halfhearted \u201cwe\u2019re trying \u2013 kind of\u201d approach is taken by other influencer sustainable-ish brands. One example is Matilda Djerf\u2019s Djerf Avenue, which promotes an image of ethically made basics. However, it describes its core values flimsily as the \u201cpursuit of sustainability\u201d which \u2013 exactly like Tala \u2013 it sees as a \u201cjourney not a destination\u201d, caveating all this with the note that \u201cachieving absolute sustainability is challenging due to the environmental impacts associated with manufacturing processes\u201d.</p> <p>The message that links all of these influencers is that they want to push you to think more sustainably \u2013 just enough to suit their branding needs \u2013 but never hard enough to cause the disruptive change that would lead to a significant environmental impact. The language is universally apologetic and soft. On Tala\u2019s webpage justifying why it participates in Black Friday, <a href=\"https://www.wearetala.com/blogs/tala-talks/tala-on-sale-explained\">it says</a>: \u201cLet\u2019s be real. As a fashion business, the \u2018holiday period\u2019 is an important time of the year. And, what\u2019s more, we don\u2019t believe that shouting at people to stop consumption altogether is really the answer to changing the entire industry.\u201d</p> <p>There is an instinct around these green-ish influencers and brands to be defensive of the good stuff they do, particularly in comparison with the wider fast fashion and influencer industries. A brand like Tala is undoubtedly better than one like Shein, and pseudo-green influencers encourage a bit less consumption than someone like <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/molly-mae-hague-fast-fashion-pretty-little-thing-b1910081.html\">Molly-Mae Hague</a>. But that doesn\u2019t make any of this truly green, nor does it make it \u201csustainable\u201d to profit from products that appear more eco friendly than they really are.</p> <p>Being a lifestyle influencer is founded on constantly maintaining your audience\u2019s attention. This means showing them something new and usually \u2013 on a daily basis \u2013 finding new products and services to keep that attention. This is why fast fashion and influencing have always been such a happy partnership. But true sustainability requires something antithetical: slowing down and being satisfied with what we have and only what we need. It\u2019s hard to see a future where this fundamental truth fits into these two symbiotic industries.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sarah Manavis is an American writer covering technology, culture, and society</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And they\u2019re not kidding: according to specialists Challenge Boxes &amp; Packaging, \u201cin the UK at Christmas time, we use a staggering <a href=\"https://www.challengepackaging.co.uk/blog/REVEALED-UK-Holiday-Waste-Statistics-Plus-Top-Tips-To-Reduce-Your-Waste-Footprint/#:~:text=We've%20researched%20how%20much,of%20wrapping%20paper%20every%20year.\">338,251 tonnes of cardboard packaging, 35,877 tonnes of plastic and 269,423 miles of wrapping paper</a>\u201d.</p> <p>So when it comes to homemade gifts, the thing to remember is that new isn\u2019t always better. First, look at what you\u2019ve already got around \u2013 bits of fabric or reusable cotton cloths, say, can easily be turned into wrapping, Ahuja and Williams say, and you can \u201chave fun using different layers and colours\u201d. Newspaper or sheets torn from your, <em>ahem</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/feast\">favourite supplement</a> will also see you right. \u201cThe joy of that is they\u2019ll get a free recipe, too,\u201d says Sadhbh Moore, co-author, with Abi Aspen Glencross, of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sustainable-kitchen-9780711265769\">Sustainable Kitchen</a>. And if you\u2019ve got any greaseproof paper to hand, twirl squares of the stuff around a tower of biscuits, for instance \u2013 \u201cMuch as you would with a bottle of wine,\u201d Moore explains \u2013 for a good plastic-free alternative to clingfilm although, granted, that does come with a single-use issue.</p> <p>Alternatively, Moore suggests repurposing paper bags from pastry purchases, especially if they have \u201cthat plastic film in the middle\u201d, which makes them ideal for homemade granola and biscuits, \u201cso you can see what\u2019s going on\u201d. The same goes for those tea boxes with windows; Moore then \u201ccollages over the branding\u201d (although that does take a bit more effort). If you are having a Blue Peter moment, however (or are looking to keep children entertained), Moore suggests making an origami box: \u201cI\u2019ve done this with children at the <a href=\"https://www.globalgeneration.org.uk/story-garden\">Story Garden in King\u2019s Cross</a>, where we made gyoza and then made origami boxes to take them home in.\u201d This strategy could also be applied to homemade chocolates, Moore says, \u201cusing newspaper, old sugar paper, card or paper for the boxes \u2013 no Sellotape, no plastic\u201d.</p> <p>If your budget allows, avoid the pile-up altogether by \u201cmaking the packaging part of the gift\u201d, suggest Ahuja and Williams, whose reusable dabbas are \u201cversatile and make a wonderful present\u201d. The likes of chutney, jam and homemade booze (\u201cForaged sloe gin or walnut liqueur are fun to make,\u201d the pair say) should go into reused jars and bottles \u2013 just be sure to sterilise them first. And if you\u2019re worried about flavour contamination (when reusing an empty pickle jar for, say, jam or biscuits), Moore suggests \u201ccutting a disc of greaseproof paper and using it as a barrier between the potentially pickley lid and the contents\u201d.</p> <p>When it comes to securing your gifts, Ahuja and Williams swap tape (\u201cIt contains plastic\u201d) for string, although you could wrap gifts with cloth instead (\u201cIt\u2019s so simple to tie\u201d). Then, to make things more festive, decorate \u201cwith foraged items such as leaves, dehydrated citrus, dried flowers, seed heads and herb sprigs\u201d. A homemade tag wouldn\u2019t go amiss, either: \u201cGet the kids involved and have them illustrate tissue from any recent deliveries.\u201d The very definition of Santa\u2019s little helpers.</p> <p>\u2022 Got a culinary dilemma?

    "content": "<p>Swimwear is one of the hardest things to make sustainably. There are a few reasons for this: it has to keep its shape when submerged in water, dry quickly afterwards and be able to withstand exposure to salt, sunshine and chlorine, which can all be corrosive. That\u2019s why it\u2019s almost always made from polyester or nylon. These materials are hydrophobic (they don\u2019t absorb moisture) while natural materials are super absorbent and become heavy and misshapen when wet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/07/dressmaking-across-generations-30-people-worked-on-our-outfits-for-three-months\">Dressmaking across generations: \u201830 people worked on our outfits for three months\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But polyester and nylon are common plastics derived from fossil fuels, which cause a litany of environmental harms. Some brands have turned to materials made from recycled plastic like Repreve (polyester) and Econyl (nylon) to mitigate the problem, but these materials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/17/how-to-make-swimwear-sustainable-check-the-material-wash-smart-and-make-it-last\">have limitations</a> too. Now sustainable swimwear designers are seeking alternative materials that will withstand playing in the sun and the surf.</p> <h2>Wood-based swimwear</h2> <p><a href=\"https://marahoffman.com/pages/pyratexswim\">Pyratex</a> Power 3 is a new fabric made from 89% lyocell (a wood-based fibre) and 11% elastane (from petrochemicals). It has been used in swimwear by the US designer Mara Hoffman. Although it is part of the brand\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels-based materials, the presence of elastane means it is not entirely plastic-free, but Hoffman says the label working to improve this. Which is good, since Philippa Grogan, a sustainability expert from Eco-Age, says \u201celastane will compromise recycling and biodegradation at the end of [the garment\u2019s] useful life\u201d.</p> <p>Lyocell is made from sustainably sourced wood and using systems that minimise the impacts of the chemicals required to turn a tree into a fabric. But questions remain about how it will perform as a bathing suit.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Rebecca van Amber, a textile scientist at RMIT University, says it\u2019s unclear how durable this material is when exposed to water, sunshine and chlorine. \u201cIt would be interesting to see if Pyratex performs as well as polyester and nylon,\u201d she says. \u201cWithout seeing performance data, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d</p> <h2>Hemp swimwear</h2> <p>The Los Angeles-based swimwear brand Natasha Tonic makes made-to-order swimwear out of <a href=\"https://natashatonic.com/collections/elements/products/prism-bikini-top-ribbed-ecru-color?variant=41867680776383\">hemp-cotton blends</a>. Because its pieces are made from natural fibres, they can perform double duty as underwear or activewear. But hemp is typically used for shirts, trousers and jackets, and is generally absorbent and not particularly fast-drying. So it\u2019s unclear how swimwear made from this material will handle being submerged in water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e926ed1856c98864caee87284c7a3efc6375ef0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e926ed1856c98864caee87284c7a3efc6375ef0/0_267_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A model wears hemp and cotton blend swimsuit by Natasha Tonic on the runway at Miami Swim fashion week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A model wears a hemp and cotton blend swimsuit by Natasha Tonic on the runway at Miami Swim fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reagan Rule/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHemp is one of my favourite fibres,\u201d Grogan says. \u201cIt can flourish without chemical intervention, it grows fast and with very little water compared to other fibres \u2026 I doubt a hemp bikini would be suitable for the Olympics, but perhaps it would be a nice addition for a holiday with lots of sunbathing?\u201d</p> <h2>Synthetics made from plants</h2> <p>The biggest advantage of making polyester out of plants like castor beans or sugar cane (rather than petrochemicals) is reducing our reliance on fossil fuels \u2013 but bioplastics, as they\u2019re sometimes called, are not a perfect solution. Amanda Johnston, a curator and education consultant for the Future Fabrics expo, says \u201cusing crops for the new era of bio-based synthetics is not without controversies due to intensive farming methods\u201d, as well as ethical concerns about growing materials rather than food on arable land.</p> <p>Another key issue is the lack of biodegradability of bioplastic polymers and the resulting microplastic pollution. And since the swimwear made using this material \u2013 called <a href=\"https://www.vitaminaswim.com/collections/plant-based-biosculpt\">Biosculpt</a> \u2013 has been blended with 23% spandex, which is a virgin synthetic, Van Amber says it cannot be recycled.</p> <h2>Alternative wetsuits</h2> <p>Wetsuits are typically made from neoprene, a synthetic rubber. \u201cTraditional neoprene is made using non-renewable petroleum \u2013 one of the most toxic manufacturing processes there is,\u201d Johnston says. This means innovations in the wetsuit space are very welcome.</p> <p>One option is a material called <a href=\"https://yamamoto-bio.com/material-e/sus2.html\">Ecoprene</a> that is limestone-based but, according to Johnston, it \u201cdoes not represent a positive development\u201d. This is due to the impacts of extracting the limestone, also a non-renewable resource, from the earth. Processing the material is chemically intensive and involves extremely high temperatures, using lots of energy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/03/what-can-old-clothes-be-made-into-right-now-puzzles-pillows-and-plastic-pellets\">What can old clothes be made into right now? Puzzles, pillows and plastic pellets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both petroleum and limestone-based neoprene have significant environmental impacts, says Johnston, \u201calthough limestone spills are a lot easier to clean up\u201d.</p> <p>Another alternative is a natural rubber neoprene called <a href=\"https://www.yulex.com/\">Yulex</a> that is sourced from hevea trees harvested and processed in Sri Lanka, using certified, safe chemistry without petroleum solvents. Although the material is blended with 15% synthetic rubber, Johnston says: \u201cYulex represents a significant improvement in this material category.\u201d</p> <h2>Biodegradable nylon</h2> <p>Another sort of nylon is derived from fossil fuels, but unlike typical plastics which take hundreds of years to biodegrade, this nylon has been designed to allow bacteria to penetrate it under landfill conditions where it breaks down into biomass and biogas. According to <a href=\"https://www.fabricsight.com/en-au/collections/amni-soul-eco\">Amni Soul Eco</a>, this will happen in about five years, in the right type of landfill.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a few things I have an issue with here,\u201d Grogan says. She says the actual biodegradation rates will differ based on the type of landfill the nylon is scrapped in, and the material has to be disposed of in a specific way for biodegradation to take place.</p> <p>Further to this, Van Amber is concerned that biodegradable nylon will produce microfibres at a faster rate. \u201cWe already know these are found everywhere on Earth, particularly in our oceans, and are having an impact on aquatic life \u2013 the extent of which we do not yet fully understand.\u201d</p> <h2>The most sustainable swimsuit</h2> <p>As the innovations now stand, the most sustainable swimwear is going to be the most durable and long-lasting, Van Amber says. \u201cUntil there is an appropriate end of life method for reuse or recycling, the best option is to use your swimsuit for as long as possible,\u201d she says. The best way to extend the life of your swimsuits is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/07/rinse-dont-wring-and-shade-dry-how-to-keep-swimwear-in-great-condition\">wash them after every wear and keep them out of the sun</a>.</p>"

It began as a vegetable garden, created for the hundreds of plant species that the artist Jo\u00e3o Machado \u2013 a botanist in his spare time \u2013 used to collect as a hobby. Jo\u00e3o, who is also the son of the famous Brazilian painter Juarez Machado, grew up amid the canvases and brushes of his father\u2019s workshop in Paris and in the lavender and sunflower fields of southern France. During other vacations, he would visit Brazil and, eventually, decided to buy a piece of land in the mountains and establish a garden with more than 400 of the plant species he\u2019d collected from around the world.</p> <p>When he found this sunny piece of land, bisected by a river, at an altitude of more than 1,000m in Visconde de Mau\u00e1, a village in the Serra da Mantiqueira \u2013 between Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 he wasted no time: this was the ideal place to put his dream of seeing his garden bloom into practice. \u201cI started by spreading the seedlings and positioning my sculptures, designing an organic path,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3db88eac1bc7b6b29d61fe1c09b3f5c20467a7dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3db88eac1bc7b6b29d61fe1c09b3f5c20467a7dc/0_344_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo\u00e3o Machado and Arasy Benitez in their living room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cosy corner: Jo\u00e3o Machado and Arasy Benitez in their living room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andr\u00e8 Nazareth/Living Inside</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soon after, Jo\u00e3o \u2013 who continued to spend long periods in France, where he worked in an art gallery \u2013 moved to Rio for good, married Arasy Benitez, a contemporary dancer from Paraguay, and together they decided to transform their piece of land into a mountain retreat and a space for artistic creation.</p> <p>\u201cWe set out to build the house, developing every detail of the project,\u201d Jo\u00e3o says. \u201cDuring that time, we stayed in a small wooden chalet, which we erected in a few days. We could already tell it was a good place to be. There was a kind of magic here and the garden was full of aromas and exotic plants.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09d98ae10c617b9c274e1dfb90ae849c60948e73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d98ae10c617b9c274e1dfb90ae849c60948e73/0_240_5760_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"open doors in the sitting room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outside in: open doors in the sitting room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andr\u00e8 Nazareth/Living Inside</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jo\u00e3o and Arasy\u2019s house was born from an essential concept: they wanted the structure to become invisible over time \u2013 totally integrated into the landscape, with its facade covered in plants.

A collection of antique masks adorns the wall, while the ceramic candlesticks in the shape of feet were made by Jo\u00e3o himself. \u201cI was careful not to fill every little corner with some detail,\u201d he says. \u201cI come from a family that likes to accumulate.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"051af446fe63eb40866ef2a7f7b31e9d1c1ca113\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/051af446fe63eb40866ef2a7f7b31e9d1c1ca113/0_663_3840_5097/753.jpg\" alt=\"The bathroom with wood pannelling\" width=\"753\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the wood: the bathroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andr\u00e8 Nazareth/Living Inside</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The couple\u2019s bedroom is minimalist: a low bed, few pieces of furniture, a canvas painted by Jo\u00e3o.

Estimates suggest it could tip past the $100bn mark a year in a decade\u2019s time.</p> <p>The review recommends the NDIS\u2019s exponential growth can be reduced by adequately lifting services outside the scheme, called foundational supports, so that fewer people need to join.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>If adopted, the changes would see the NDIS\u2019s individualised funding packages form part of a spectrum of accessibility and inclusion measures, including \u201cfoundational supports\u201d and mainstream services over a five-year period.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/06/albanese-strikes-105bn-deal-with-states-to-split-cost-of-non-ndis-disability-services-in-return-for-gst-funding\">federal government agreed to a 50-50 funding model with the states and territories for these additional services</a> and is understood to have suggested a combined total of approximately $10bn over the next five years be agreed.</p> <p>That figure would see foundational supports receive an additional $2bn a year across the country.</p> <p>The review\u2019s authors estimate about $2.67bn is already spent on foundational supports across the country, despite services being considered as nonexistent.</p> <p>The funding is just one aspect. There\u2019s also work to be done to get the workforce available and ready as the care sector faces continuing skills shortages, according to Lowe.</p> <p>He said he wanted to see the federal government provide more clarity about its plan next year as work gets under way to overhaul the way disability support services are funded.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very complicated and the risks of it not all working to plan, I think, are quite high,\u201d Lowe said.</p> <h2>\u2018Too many people are falling through the cracks\u2019</h2> <p>The precise nature of foundational supports is unclear but, at a high level, advocates understand them to include information and advice services, and less complex support services that will assist someone to live independently, such as cooking, cleaning and shopping support, as well as mobility aids and equipment \u2013 similarly to how My Aged Care currently functions for older Australians.</p> <p>Foundational supports are also expected to include investment in early support programs for children with developmental concerns and disability to be delivered in schools and childcare centres.</p> <p>Nick Avery, chief executive of South West Autism Network (Swan), said this recommendation could lead to fewer autistic people becoming NDIS participants.</p> <p>\u201cIt would very much depend on what supports would be delivered through Foundational Supports, and what type of assessments are used to determine access to the NDIS,\u201d Avery said.</p> <p>Some foundational supports existed before the NDIS, including home and community care programs, and occasional state-funded therapy or early intervention programs. But these were patchy, limited and often difficult to access, especially for regional Australians.</p> <p>\u201cMost people had little or no support,\u201d Avery said. In Western Australia, where Swan is based, there was also the community aids and equipment program, \u201cwhich again was extremely difficult to access funding through. People often spent a lot of time fundraising or applied for grants [or] donations from charities.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/06/albanese-strikes-105bn-deal-with-states-to-split-cost-of-non-ndis-disability-services-in-return-for-gst-funding\">Albanese strikes $10.5bn deal with states to split cost of non-NDIS disability services in return for GST funding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While foundational supports could see some people rolled off the NDIS, Avery said there was already a lot of unmet need in the community. She noted the long wait times to access a paediatrician or formal diagnostic testing.</p> <p>\u201cWe are often contacted by undiagnosed autistic adults who are unable to afford the cost of the diagnostic assessment,\u201d Avery said. \u201cThey are in need of supports, either Foundational Supports or NDIS, and currently have access to neither. Being undiagnosed, they are often unable to access Disability Employment Services or the Disability Support Pension, and are trapped on JobSeeker Payment, struggling (and often failing) to meet the mutual obligation requirements.</p> <p>\u201cCurrently too many people are falling through the cracks.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Creating a continuum of support\u2019</h2> <p>The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, last week at a Committee for Economic Development Australia event said the NDIS had \u201cstruggled under its own weight\u201d and had become \u201cthe only lifeboat in the ocean as non-NDIS disability supports have eroded since the introduction of the scheme\u201d.</p> <p>But he cautioned changes were not about kicking people off it.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not about moving hundreds of thousands of people out of the scheme at all. It\u2019s about taking some of the pressure off whether or not you\u2019re in or out, creating a continuum of support,\u201d Shorten said.</p> <p>The federal government announced it would invest an extra $511m in the NDIS to make it more sustainable over the next two years during the release of its mid-year economic and fiscal outlook last week.</p> <p>It is expected details on what the extra foundational supports to be delivered over the next years, and how much funding will be allocated towards them, will be released in the first half of next year.</p>"

    "content": "<p>China\u2019s economy is struggling. The recovery after the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions is faltering. Its trade with the rest of the world is shrinking. A decade-long boom in house prices has come to an end.</p> <p>The most obvious manifestation of the troubles besetting the world\u2019s second biggest economy is that China is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/08/chinese-economy-expected-to-have-slipped-into-deflation-as-recovery-falters\">now officially in deflation</a>. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/12/us-inflation-rate-june-2023#:~:text=The%20latest%20consumer%20price%20index,clashed%20with%20burgeoning%20consumer%20demand.\">US</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">UK</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/31/eurozone-economic-inflation-gdp-germany-growth\">eurozone</a>, prices are rising \u2013 albeit not quite as fast as they were a few months ago \u2013 but in China they are actually falling.</p> <p>News of the 0.3% year-on-year fall in prices inevitably prompted speculation that China was about to be permanently gripped by deflation, as was the case for neighbouring <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/china-is-no-1990s-japan-but-it-could-have-been/\">Japan</a> after its asset-price bubble burst at the end of the 1980s.</p> <p>Such fears are premature, at least for now. There were one-off factors involving the price of food that explained last month\u2019s fall. Core inflation \u2013 which excludes volatile items such as energy and food \u2013 not only remained positive, but actually rose from 0.4% to 0.8%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/09/china-economy-deflation-interest-rates-impact\">In previous downturns the world turned to China as an engine of growth \u2013 this time that driver may not be there</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That said, China\u2019s communist leaders are clearly worried about the state of the economy, and they are right to be concerned. Attempts to rebalance the economy away from investment and exports towards consumer spending are still in their early stages. Factories are seeing demand fall because of the slowdown in global demand.</p> <p>It is not just consumer prices that are falling. The prices of goods leaving China\u2019s factories have fallen by more than 4% over the past year, which will eventually feed through into cheaper imports for the rest of the world. Any downward pressure on inflation will be welcomed by developed country central banks.</p> <p>There\u2019s more bad news. In an echo of the events that prompted the global financial crisis of 2008, house prices are falling and property prices are feeling the pinch. Country Garden, one of China\u2019s leading private sector developers, missed two bond payments <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-country-garden-missed-two-dollar-bond-coupon-payments-2023-08-08/\">earlier this week</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps most worryingly for the authorities in Beijing, youth unemployment is already running at 20% and could rise further as newly qualified graduates look for work in an economy where growth is slowing. Ever since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, the Communist party has been anxious to avoid having large numbers of angry, unemployed young people protesting on the streets.</p> <p>In the longer term, the president, Xi Jinping, has no real alternative but to stick to his rebalancing strategy. The reason the economy grew strongly in the years leading up to the pandemic was that Beijing kept the money taps full on. The state invested heavily in new manufacturing capacity, and property companies expanded on the back of plentiful supplies of cheap finance. As a result, China now has a vast amount of underutilised factories and homes that nobody wants to buy.</p> <p>Does this mean Beijing will adopt a hands-off approach to the economy? Almost certainly not. Deflation \u2013 even if temporary \u2013 will prompt the authorities to stimulate demand through lower interest rates and higher government spending.</p> <p>In all likelihood, though, the interventions will be smaller and more targeted than in the past. The China expert George Magnus says China\u2019s long-term sustainable growth rate is now 2%-3%, a far cry from the 10% seen in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis. The road to that lower, better-balanced growth is bumpy and strewn with obstacles.</p>"

    "content": "<p>UK universities would be hugely damaged by a sustained diplomatic rift between Britain and China, according to a report that predicts difficulty in replacing the Chinese students who now take up more than one in four international PhD places.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/efforts-to-reduce-universities-dependence-on-china-stalling-report-says\">study</a>, co-authored by the former universities minister Jo Johnson, found that many leading institutions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/14/overseas-students-uk-universities-income\">remain highly dependent</a> on Chinese students for tuition fee income as well as to fill postgraduate research courses in subjects such as economics, science and technology.</p> <p>A sudden inflaming of tensions between the UK and China \u2013 recently a parliamentary researcher was arrested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/11/uk-parliamentary-researcher-arrested-for-alleged-chinese-spying-says-he-is-innocent\">for allegedly spying for China</a> \u2013 could see the pipeline shut off, leaving UK universities with few viable alternatives after the collapse in EU student numbers coming to the UK since Brexit.</p> <p>Johnson, a visiting professor at King\u2019s College London\u2019s policy institute, said: \u201cThe sector continues to follow a \u2018cross your fingers\u2019 strategy that decoupling is in the future never necessary for China, in the same ways it was for relations with Russia in February 2022. The China question therefore to a great degree remains unanswered.</p> <p>\u201cThe government must urgently help universities with a framework for how to maximise the benefits from research collaboration and student and academic mobility while managing the downsides, including the risks to national security from bad-faith actors and the dangers of over-reliance on a single country.\u201d</p> <p>The KCL report says the single most effective way for the government to reduce the reliance on Chinese students would be to raise tuition fees for UK undergraduates in line with inflation for the first time since 2016, when fees were set at \u00a39,250 a year.</p> <p>\u201cTeaching UK students at this level will be loss-making for many higher education institutions, leaving them with few options other than to recruit international students whose fees are unregulated,\u201d the report concludes.</p> <p>In 2021-22, more than 3,100 Chinese nationals enrolled in the first year of a doctoral programme at UK universities, far above the 2,000 combined from the three next largest countries \u2013 the US, India and Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>\u201cWith large emerging countries such as India unlikely to be plausible substitutes for the foreseeable future, finding alternatives to China that reduce its importance in the UK knowledge economy remains no simple undertaking,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>In the space of five years, the proportion of international PhD places held by Chinese nationals has risen from 17% to 28% while the number of EU doctoral students has fallen by 42%. International students take up just under half of the total PhD places at UK universities.</p> <p>The KCL report also notes that Chinese doctoral students are concentrated in leading research centres: the most recent figures show 80% were studying at universities belonging to the Russell Group.</p> <p>Nine Russell Group universities had more than 5,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students from China in 2021-22, and University College London alone has more than 10,000 Chinese students in its student body of 44,000.</p> <p>Last week it was revealed that a parliamentary researcher had been arrested under the Official Secrets Act, leading Rishi Sunak to confront the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, at Sunday\u2019s G20 summit over China\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d interference. The researcher has said he is \u201ccompletely innocent\u201d.</p> <p>A report by a House of Lords committee castigates the Office for Students (OfS), the higher education regulator for England, for failing to prepare the sector for the financial instability that the withdrawal of Chinese students would cause.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://ukparliament.shorthandstories.com/the-work-of-the-office-for-students-industry-regulators-lords-report/index.html\">report by the industry and regulators committee</a> says there is a \u201cworrying complacency\u201d over the dependency on international student fees, which it says fails to take account of the \u201crisks of geopolitical shifts\u201d, especially involving students from China.</p> <p>The committee held a series of hearings during its investigation into the OfS\u2019s operations and its final report is highly critical, arguing that the OfS \u201clacks independence from the government and its actions often appear driven by the ebb and flow of short-term political priorities and media headlines.\u201d</p> <p>Clive Hollick, the committee\u2019s chair, said: \u201cAt a time when the higher education sector faces a looming crisis caused by financial instability, increased costs, industrial action and reduced EU research funding, it is vital that the sector\u2019s regulator is fit for purpose.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it was evident throughout our inquiry that the OfS is failing to deliver and does not command the trust or respect of either providers or students, the very people whose interests it is supposed to defend. We were surprised by the regulator\u2019s view that the sector\u2019s finances are in good shape, which is not an assessment that we or most of our witnesses share.\u201d</p> <p>James Wharton, the OfS\u2019s chair, said in response that his organisation was \u201calive to significant risks, including the impact of a fixed undergraduate tuition fee, cost pressures and an over-reliance by some on international students. Our important work in this area is often not publicly visible.\u201d</p>"

They joined the growing \u201cred\u201d or \u201cavoid\u201d list in the Good Fish Guide, which aims to help consumers make ocean-friendly choices.</p> <p>The guide, compiled by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), provides environmental ratings using a traffic light system. Of the 337 wild fisheries around the British Isles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/04/british-diners-warned-off-more-fish-types-due-to-low-stocks-in-waters\">only 13% have a green rating</a> and 25% are red. So what do you need to know to make sustainable fish choices?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/04/british-diners-warned-off-more-fish-types-due-to-low-stocks-in-waters\">British diners warned off more fish types due to low populations in waters</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What has happened?</h2> <p>In the autumn update, The MCS reviewed 117 seafood ratings, leading to 53 changes including 19 moving down the sustainability scale.</p> <p>Of these, a dozen received red ratings, including: pollack caught in the Channel and Celtic Seas; beam-trawled plaice from the eastern Channel; dover sole from the Irish Sea; prawns from the North Sea and sea bass from the west of Scotland. However, North Sea and Channel mullet and North Sea sprat moved up to amber, resulting in a net increase of eight on the red list.</p> <h2>How can I ensure the fish I eat is sustainable?</h2> <p>A good place to start is on the<a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/ocean-emergency/sustainable-seafood/the-good-fish-guide/\"> Good Fish Guide website</a> (it can also be downloaded on to your phone) so you can check a fish rating when planning a meal or in the supermarket. \u201cWe always recommend people look for \u2018what, where and how\u2019 on labels,\u201d says the Good Fish Guide manager, Charlotte Coombes. \u201cIf that\u2019s there, you\u2019ve got enough information to get a rating.\u201d</p> <p>Alternatively, look for the Marine Stewardship Council\u2019s (MSC) blue tick on wild-caught fish and seafood (or the Aquaculture Stewardship Council\u2019s (ASC) green logo on farmed products). The label is the \u201csimplest way for the consumer to know that they can eat the seafood without having to worry about whether or not it is sustainable\u201d, says George Clark, the MSC\u2019s UK &amp; Ireland programme director. This applies to everything from tinned tuna, fresh fish or frozen fish fingers. </p> <h2>Now I know what to look for, what should I buy?</h2> <p>Fish lovers tend to eat the same things over and over, with 80% of seafood eaten in the UK made up of the \u201cbig five\u201d: cod, haddock, salmon, tuna and prawns. This puts a lot of pressure on a handful of wild stocks and, while there are some sustainable sources, experts suggest some <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/ocean-emergency/sustainable-seafood/seafood-buying-guides/5-sustainable-seafood-swaps/\">sustainable swaps</a>. Replace cod with European hake which has the same meaty texture. Instead of haddock, buy North Sea plaice. If it has to be tuna, buy skipjack or albacore caught by pole and line (or try sardines).</p> <h2>Everyone says to eat more oily fish, such as salmon, is that OK?</h2> <p>Wild-caught Atlantic salmon is on the red list, so buy Pacific (pink, red or keta) caught in Alaska, organic or ASC-certified Scottish salmon. \u201cAnything that relies on rivers as well as the sea, like salmon and eels, is really under pressure,\u201d says Coombs. It\u2019s not easy to replace salmon\u2019s orange-pink flesh, but any firm white fish, such as hake or haddock, can be cooked in a similar way. Another option is farmed rainbow trout. </p> <h2>What about prawns?</h2> <p>Prawns can be sustainable, depending on the species, and where and how they were caught or farmed, so check the information on the packet. Arctic northern prawns (or shrimp), for example, with a green rating are the best option, whereas North Sea ones have just joined the red list. For king and tiger prawns look for eco-labels, including organic or ASC, and avoid buying uncertified ones from places like Indonesia, Vietnam and India.</p> <h2>Should I stop going to the fish and chip shop?</h2> <p>No. Andrew Crook, the president of the National Federation of Fish Friers, suggests customers ask shop owners about their policy but insists the industry is focused on sustainable sourcing. \u201cWithout cod and haddock there won\u2019t be any fish shops so it is in our interest to have well-managed fisheries,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d always encourage people to be a bit more adventurous, there\u2019s a lot of hake that comes into the UK that is caught by the domestic fleet.\u201d</p> <h2>Is sea bass totally off the menu?</h2> <p>No, but the guide advice is to buy the farmed fish. In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/10/sea-bass-stocks-on-brink-of-collapsing-warn-conservationists\">sea bass was in \u201creal trouble\u201d</a>, says Coombs. Stocks have been recovering since emergency management measures were introduced but they are not yet where they should be.</p> <h2>Is farmed or wild fish better?</h2> <p>Both systems have good options and really unsustainable ones.

    "content": "<p>Having dodged corporate jobs to find a way to keep travelling, Darrell Wade was, as he tells it, pretty pleased with life as his business took off. But the climate crisis wasn\u2019t yet on his radar.</p> <p>The Australian entrepreneur was on holiday in Botswana in 2005, fresh from winning an award for responsible travel, when he read <em>The Weather Makers</em> \u2013 a book by scientist Tim Flannery spelling out the causes and consequences of global heating. \u201cI was feeling chuffed, and then I read that book. And I thought, holy shit, we\u2019re a disaster \u2013 we\u2019re doing the wrong thing.\u201d</p> <p>The co-founder and chair of Intrepid Travel \u2013 the world\u2019s largest travel company to be accredited as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/14/us-small-business-certified-b-corporation\" title=\"\">B Corporation</a> for its social and environmental performance \u2013 Wade appears genial and self-deprecating, frequently laughing, but not pulling punches. Minutes earlier, he had told delegates attending the Abta convention, the UK travel industry\u2019s annual get-together, that their record on climate was a clear \u201cfail\u201d, sparking a brief outbreak of self-flagellation in the conference hall in Bodrum, Turkey.</p> <p>After spending years as an advocate for sustainability standards within the industry, Wade told them, he had found one in three travel firms were still \u201cactively hostile\u201d to policies aimed at reducing travel\u2019s carbon footprint. Another third were ambivalent \u2013 and the better ones, well, they weren\u2019t doing enough.</p> <p>That includes his own company, he admits \u2013 even though Intrepid\u2019s adventure travel holidays have been audited as climate neutral since 2010. \u201cSo in theory, we\u2019re doing our bit, but, you know, the reality is, we weren\u2019t doing enough.\u201d</p> <p>That carbon audit has, as Wade acknowledges, one very big caveat: Intrepid does not sell the flights that take its customers, mainly from the UK, US and Australia, to the starting point of their low-impact, sustainable tours. Is that not a bit like Heathrow proudly claiming to be net zero, if it wasn\u2019t for all the pesky planes? \u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s very similar,\u201d he says. \u201cConsumers want to take a holiday. Let\u2019s say half of those holidays are taken with aviation \u2013 we\u2019ve got to fix our industry.\u201d</p> <p>He believes there is a role for offsetting and, eventually, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/10/airlines-hope-that-sustainable-fuels-will-propel-them-to-a-guilt-free-future\" title=\"\">sustainable aviation fuels</a>, when (or if) they are made on a large scale from green hydrogen. But, he says, travel has to move from relying on offsets to \u201cdefinitely now reducing emissions per person per day\u201d. \u201cOffsets have to be credible,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd at the moment, they\u2019re not. That\u2019s the reality.\u201d</p> <p>There are good business incentives to go greener, Wade points out, not least cost savings in fuel bills. And despite there being no imminent answer to travel\u2019s environmental footprint, he maintains: \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to hold people\u2019s feet to the fire, talk about it, [say] that hey, we do have a problem. And all the rhetoric in the world is not going to solve this problem. You need taxation, you need regulation, you need media pressure \u2013 you need litigation as a last resort.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We really go in for cultural immersion, to fairly extreme lengths \u2013 to sometimes even rub the nose of our passengers in all aspects of the country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wade co-founded Intrepid in Australia in 1989 after a brief foray into corporate life following university and travelling. He hoped to establish the kind of firm he wanted to actually travel with, but did not exist \u2013 something for the ex-backpacker who liked that way of seeing the world, but only had a few weeks\u2019 annual leave from work.</p> <p>After nearly quitting the startup for a paid job and bigger salary when a first child came along, he stuck at it, with eventually lucrative results. Wade stood back as chief executive in 2017 to enjoy more travelling time, but, with co-founder Geoff Manchester, still owns the majority of the firm (\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m what you\u2019d call fabulously rich, but I\u2019m doing OK,\u201d he admits.)</p> <p>French investors Genairgy, co-owners of sports retailer Decathlon, bought a 30% stake in 2021. Intrepid took more than 145,000 people on tour in 112 countries in 2022, and is aiming to be a A$1bn (\u00a3520m) concern by 2030, with a 25% current rate of annual growth.</p> <p>\u201cThe market seems to be coming our way,\u201d Wade says, citing the convergence of \u201cglobal megatrends\u201d around sustainability, connection and experiences. \u201cWe\u2019re in that sweet spot. We kind of grow despite ourselves \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re especially clever, we\u2019re just in the right place.\u201d</p> <p>Wade differentiates Intrepid from other rivals now in this market, saying: \u201cWe really go in for cultural immersion, to fairly extreme lengths \u2013 to sometimes even rub the nose of our passengers in all aspects of the country, good or bad.\u201d</p> <p>The key practical difference is using less conventional accommodation and more public transport. \u201cIt just has that vitality to it. It\u2019s not necessarily more comfortable \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s just the opposite \u2013 but it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s vital,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/14/i-was-overeating-the-zoe-nutrition-app-founders-on-diet-raising-millions-and-the-perfect-microbiome\">\u2018I was overeating\u2019: the Zoe nutrition app founders on diet, raising millions and the perfect microbiome</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI hate places like this,\u201d he adds, meaning the all-inclusive resort hosting Abta\u2019s convention. Wade is here, he says, at the cajoling of his wife (\u201cthe original communist\u201d) to use the platform to call for change. \u201cBecause places like this \u2013 you never talk to people. If you don\u2019t have that, then you\u2019re missing one of the great rewards of travel, and that is that exchange of ideas.\u201d</p> <p>Overall, Wade says he feels no guilt about a role that promotes globetrotting travel, but he does have a sense of responsibility: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to answer for, particularly on the climate-change side. The flip side of that is that I think the industry has a lot to be proud about as well.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst we get down on ourselves, the travel industry does an incredible amount of good. I genuinely think it has probably lifted more people out of poverty than the international NGO sector has, just by the money we spend. So as much as, from an environmental perspective, I\u2019d say we shouldn\u2019t be getting in planes, there\u2019s the other side of the coin, which is hugely beneficial.

    "content": "<p>I love the Penrith Panthers too much. That\u2019s not altogether unusual. Loving your team too much is what sports fandom is all about \u2013 irrational levels of devotion to something that ultimately doesn\u2019t really matter in the grand scheme of things.</p> <p>Traditional Guardian readers might understand this passion as the way they feel when, say, they see an interesting bird, or when a new adaptation of play gets a three star review that reads like a four, or perhaps when there\u2019s a new treatise about a minor inconvenience caused by a local council.</p> <p>Passion comes in all forms. I have written extensively, some would say far too often, about what this passion means to me personally. How it goes beyond simple fandom and is channelled into community pride from a home that is more often the source of ridicule. But what is most unusual about this kind of passion is that it is not supposed to be rewarded. Loving your football team is supposed to be an effort in endurance that teaches us how to suffer heartbreak and come out the other side still capable of hope. We are all used to that experience. We understand how to cope with that. What is new and what is strange is the idea of sustained success.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/sep/24/clinical-panthers-and-fearless-broncos-set-up-nrl-grand-final-clash-of-styles\">Clinical Panthers and fearless Broncos set up NRL grand final clash of styles | Nick Tedeschi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the dream. Perhaps that\u2019s underselling it. Rugby league fans don\u2019t really dream of this kind of sustained success. You dream about things that are more likely \u2013 say, winning the lottery, or being pulled out of the crowd to kick the game-winning conversion. You certainly don\u2019t dream about being on the verge of a three-peat. That\u2019s a little too absurd, even for fantasy. The good times cannot last. The universe would not allow it. It would violate a law of thermodynamics.</p> <p>Traditionally, you would spend an article like this trashing your opponents. I don\u2019t feel the need to do that. This Broncos team is fun and charismatic. They have grown from the doldrums of a disappointing season to be flashy, free, a little cocky and a lot of fun. It\u2019s a familiar tale. In fact, it was the journey Penrith went on from 2019 to 2020. Even our records are startlingly similar (Broncos with the slight edge, going from 13 wins, 11 losses to a grand final the next season, as opposed to Penrith\u2019s 11 wins, 13 losses).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Loving your football team is supposed to be an effort in endurance </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It would be easy to try to win over Guardian readers by making a snide reference to the fact that the Broncos are majority-owned by News Corp, not to mention the even more shocking and morally questionable fact that they\u2019re openly from Queensland. But that\u2019s not really what this is about. I am happy for them. Their fans have endured the dire years and have returned. The league is better when the Broncos are strong.</p> <p>On the other side, the Penrith Panthers have become the villains of the competition. The main criticism is never on the style of play but rather the style of celebration after the play. They are arrogant, you see. They believe they\u2019re better than everyone else. Almost as if that has been empirically proven over the last few years. I took my nieces to watch Penrith play the first round of the finals and deep in my heart I felt as if I was doing them a disservice. Don\u2019t you understand? It cannot be this good for ever. Yet here they were, jumping and screaming and clapping. They were enjoying the moment.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/30/the-nrl-grand-final-result-doesnt-matter-penrith-panthers-are-already-champions#comments\">I wrote about my dear friend Steph</a> who was by my side, game after game, throughout the bad years and the good. The last game she saw was her beloved team becoming back-to-back premiers. The season has not felt the same without her, cheering on the team in her absolutely one-eyed way. Yet now, for me, every game has become a reminder of her. I think about her every time the team runs out. I feel her spirit in every cheer. We are lucky to be here. We have the opportunity to celebrate our team, our community, and share our love with those around us.</p> <p>When we run out on Sunday, I am not going to be worried about what might happen. I am not concerned with titles or how this time will be remembered. I will enjoy the flight, not fear the fall. Right now, we are living the dream of every sports fan. It would be a crime not to enjoy it. Also, we are the greatest team of the NRL era and we\u2019re going to win.</p> <p>\u2022 James Colley is a comedian, author and television writer from western Sydney</p>"

If that fails, the trio have the right to publish their concerns in the company\u2019s annual report and through full-page newspaper adverts, or refer the matter for legal investigation and arbitration at the enterprise chamber of the court of appeal in Amsterdam.</p> <p>The Tony\u2019s chief executive, Douglas Lamont, said he hoped the move would inspire other brands to follow suit.</p> <p>\u201cA growing number of purpose-driven companies are looking for ways to secure their impact models at the core of their business permanently and irrevocably, independent of shareholder structure,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWith this model, we hope to role-model what we believe to be a powerful mechanism to protect our mission and sourcing principles forever and act as an inspiration for others to look more closely at what they can do to secure their mission too.\u201d</p> <p>Goldman said: \u201cI\u2019ve learnt from my own experience that, even when we create companies with the highest aspirations in mission, times change, people change, new people come in, and organisations change too. So, no mission is guaranteed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike anything new and unproven, I\u2019m sure we will learn along the way. But I also hope our approach can become a model for other purpose-driven brands.\u201d</p>"

Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, aims to connect 20,000 students to schools with protected bike lanes, while Milan in Italy submitted a proposal to connect 40 schools with a radial network of bike routes.</p> <p>The plan for Bogot\u00e1 is specifically aimed at the mobility of children in a low-income part of the Colombian capital, based around a programme known as a <em>ciempi\u00e9s</em>, or centipedes \u2013 organised walking caravans that help students get to and from school safely.</p> <p>James Anderson leads the government innovation programme at Bloomberg Philanthropies. He said the prize received entries from 275 cities across 66 countries, arguing this was a sign of the global interest in active travel.</p> <p>\u201cDemand and interest in urban cycling is skyrocketing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe need to offer residents more sustainable mobility options is also urgent and critical. But we all know that city infrastructure has not kept pace.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the level of innovation, we haven\u2019t seen the level of ambition that the moment demands.\u201d</p> <p>The judges, he said, were not just looking for plans with coherent networks, but ideas that engaged with local communities, particularly ones seen as traditionally hard to reach for active travel schemes, such as Wellington\u2019s focus on the city\u2019s M\u0101ori population.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition now in city halls everywhere that expertise comes from lots of places, and a lot of it comes from the community,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want people in communities that have not typically participated in some of the sustainable mobility options, you need to go there and you need to work with them, need to get their thoughts on how to make cycling infrastructure useful in their day-to-day lives.\u201d</p>"

Now several UK and European events are introducing measures to reduce their impact, using locally sourced food, low-emission transport and renewable energy. Sustainability-minded shows range from new-generation affairs, such as Italy\u2019s Terraforma, to veterans like the Isle of Wight festival.</p> <h2>Green Gathering, Monmouthshire</h2> <p>The family-friendly <a href=\"https://www.greengathering.org.uk/\">Green Gathering</a> festival (3-6 August) usually hosts a diverse bill, from sea shanty-loving bands to politically conscious rappers \u2013 though 2023\u2019s lineup remains TBC. This year the festival that won the 2023 International Greener festival award (AGF) from environmental non-profit <a href=\"https://www.agreenerfestival.com/\">A Greener Future</a> will feature 100% renewable power, veggie food, upcycling workshops and a non-pushy promotion of low-impact living.<br><em>Shuttle buses from Chepstow railway station, weekend camping from \u00a3130</em></p> <h2>DGTL Amsterdam</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba27b0342bd7d57a20a7f32d7a5de3c1081bf85a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba27b0342bd7d57a20a7f32d7a5de3c1081bf85a/0_134_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"concert crowd in a glass-roofed space\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Two more International AGF awards went to <a href=\"https://dgtl.nl/\">DGTL</a>\u2019s Dutch edition: for green transport and for innovation with reusables (called circularity).

This year\u2019s festival will run from 7-9 April in Amsterdam-Noord\u2019s former dockyards. DGTL has a plant-based, waste-free food court and recycles water.

    "content": "<p>Imagine a building material that is beautiful, strong, plentiful, durable and fireproof, whose use requires low levels of energy and low emissions of greenhouse gases. It is one of the most ancient known to humanity, the stuff of dolmens and temples and cathedrals and Cotswolds cottages, but also one whose sustainability makes it well-suited to the future. Such a material, according to a growing body of opinion in the world of construction, is among us. It\u2019s called stone.</p> <p>Last week I sat in the roof garden of a hefty pile of masonry in central London, talking to three advocates of this magnificent substance: engineer Steve Webb, Pierre Bidaud of the Rutland-based <a href=\"https://www.thestonemasonrycompany.co.uk/\">Stonemasonry Company</a> and architect Amin Taha. My initial request, driven by a journalistic preference for highlighting individuals, had been to meet Taha alone, but he pointed out that their work is a collaboration of different disciplines. The building on top of which we met is their joint creation: the six-storey, five-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/19/amin-taha-15-clerkenwell-close-miesian-flintstone-poetry\">Clerkenwell block</a> where Taha has his office and his home.</p> <p>Their point is that stone has been supplanted in the industrial era by steel, concrete and mass-produced bricks, and is used (if at all) mostly as a thin cosmetic facing, while the hard work of holding up a building is done by the upstart alternatives. They argue that solid stone can once again form the walls and structure of building, with benefits for the environment and for the beauty of architecture. Any form of the material \u2013 limestone, sandstone, basalt, granite \u2013 can, depending on its properties, be used.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ab369981c8c0ba1c550641a379de4328bb32ed2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ab369981c8c0ba1c550641a379de4328bb32ed2/135_31_6477_4377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The load-bearing raw limestone facade of 15 Clerkenwell Close, home to eight flats and Amin Taha\u2019s practice, Groupwork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The load-bearing raw limestone facade of 15 Clerkenwell Close, home to eight flats and Amin Taha\u2019s practice, Groupwork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Webb explains how the strength of stone compares well with steel and concrete, yet its environmental impact is far lower. The latter require several different energy-consuming activities, including extraction, smelting, transport, processing and installation. Stone only needs to be cut out from a quarry, taken to a site and put in place. Where the many ingredients of steel and concrete require multiple holes to be dug in the ground, not to mention such things as blast furnaces and rolling mills, the stonework for a given project only needs one.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s conceivable that the era of concrete will prove only an interlude in the far longer history of stone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The planet, as Taha points out, is made mostly of stone. \u201cWe are sitting on the cold dry skin of boiling magma,\u201d as he puts it, so we are in no danger of running out. For the same reason, stone should almost always be locally available, which keeps the environmental costs of transport down. The material is long-lasting and recyclable. \u201cAny stone building is a quarry,\u201d says Bidaud. \u201cIt can be dismantled.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, 21st-century engineering allows stone to be used more effectively than ever before. The material is naturally strong in compression \u2013 that is, when loads are pushed down on it \u2013 which means it is good for walls, columns and arches, but less so if it is stretched or bent, as in beams or floor slabs. It is now possible to combine stone with a (sparing) use of steel such that it can perform like reinforced concrete.</p> <p>Webb, Bidaud and Taha are putting their ideas into practice, together and with others. Next year, a 10-storey residential tower is due for completion on Finchley Road in north London (by Taha\u2019s practice <a href=\"http://groupwork.uk.com/\">Groupwork</a> and Webb\u2019s firm <a href=\"https://www.webbyates.com/\">Webb Yates Engineers</a>), whose load-bearing stone structure will make it one of the most remarkable buildings in modern Britain. The three are collaborating on a grand new private house whose masonry vaults look almost medieval in their craftsmanship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"13a4fbbd762a83fd1ac1004f6eac730530747cb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13a4fbbd762a83fd1ac1004f6eac730530747cb0/0_0_1904_2895/658.jpg\" alt=\"a bow-fronted brick tower block on Finchley road\" width=\"658\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A CGI of the \u2018remarkable\u2019 forthcoming Finchley Road residential tower, north London, being built by Claire Piffaut, Luc Tamborero and Nicolas Dubois of Ateliers Romeo, Steve Webb of Webb Yates and Amin Taha of Groupwork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Groupwork</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They also cite works by others, such as an <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/986030/solid-stone-residential-blocks-atelier-archiplein\">eight-storey, all-stone social housing building in Geneva</a> by local architects <a href=\"http://www.archiplein.com/index.php?p=projects.index\">Atelier Archiplein</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/social-housing-in-mallorca-spain-by-ibavi\">the Salvador Espriu project</a> on the edge of Palma, Mallorca, whose graceful stone ceilings bely the fact that these are affordable homes built by a government housing institute called Ibavi.</p> <p>These are important examples, as the greatest obstacle to the widespread use of stone is its perceived and actual expense. It\u2019s seen as a luxury item, something for the homes of the one-per-centers. Its use in other countries on relatively low-cost projects shows that it can also be a material for everyday purposes.</p> <p>Webb, Bidaud and Taha argue that stone doesn\u2019t have to be costly. Taha, for example, has demonstrated that you can cut stone into bricks at the same cost or cheaper than the more usual fired-clay kind, with less than one fortieth of the carbon emissions, which has led to 10 quarries offering them as a commercial product. The problem is rather \u201cforces of habit in the building industry\u201d, where \u201cbig beast contractors\u201d have invested in concrete and steel and rely on familiar suppliers of these materials. It \u201ctakes time for the whole industry to swivel\u201d, they say.</p> <p>Meanwhile, architects, contractors and engineers persist in the old ways. Two billion bricks of the traditional, energy-hungry, carbon-intensive kind are bought in this country every year. Steel and concrete remain the standard options for a wide range of building tasks. Webb is scathing about professional inertia on the subject, about architects \u201cwho protest about climate emergency, cycle to work and eat locally grown tomatoes\u201d but don\u2019t examine their own decisions about construction techniques.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"59e11aff78f870303049bc67a71fec1d0b4dfd44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59e11aff78f870303049bc67a71fec1d0b4dfd44/0_0_2524_1428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The subterranean vault of a private house being built by Claire Piffaut, Luc Tamborero and Nicolas Dubois of Ateliers Romeo, Steve Webb of Webb Yates and Amin Taha of Groupwork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"566\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Almost medieval in its craftsmanship\u2019: the subterranean vault of a private house being built by Claire Piffaut, Luc Tamborero and Nicolas Dubois of Ateliers Romeo, Steve Webb of Webb Yates and Amin Taha of Groupwork. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Soar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can get a glimpse of the highly appealing alternatives in a display at the Design Museum in London, <a href=\"https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/how-to-build-a-low-carbon-home\">How to Build a Low-Carbon Home</a>, where the work of Taha, Webb and Bidaud is on show (until March 2024) alongside structures in wood and straw. Here, and in the other projects they design and celebrate, they offer a compelling vision of a constructional world that is delightful as well as sustainable.</p> <p>Who could look at the solid stone structure of, for example, the Mallorcan social housing, where the forces of nature and the work of humans is evident in the fabric, and prefer the processed surfaces and plasticised finishes of their British equivalents? And the great thing about stone is that, having been used for millennia, it\u2019s well tested. It\u2019s conceivable, indeed, that the era of concrete will prove only an interlude in the far longer history of stone. Such a shift won\u2019t happen easily, but it\u2019s an outcome worth striving for.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Yasmeen Mjalli, the founder and creative director of <a href=\"https://nolcollective.com/\">N\u00f6l Collective</a>, has never met the women who weave the Majdalawi fabric she uses in her collections. It is a notable exception to the close, in-person relationships she has cultivated with her suppliers. Despite living in Ramallah, a city only about 50 miles from Gaza, communication with the women who live within this besieged coastal strip<strong> </strong>takes place solely over WhatsApp. Gaza is described by humanitarians as an \u201copen-air prison\u201d \u2013 Israeli laws mean Gazans are rarely allowed out of the city, and other Palestinians who live in the West Bank are even less likely to be allowed in.</p> <p>Majdalawi fabric, which is woven using a single treadle loom [a foot-operated machine], originates from the Palestinian village of al-Majdal Asqalan. The village was occupied by Israeli forces in 1948, its inhabitants were made refugees, and the centuries-old practice would have died out if not for a cultural preservation project that set up a handful of studios in Gaza in the 90s. This artisan is one of the local women\u2019s cooperatives that N\u00f6l Collective works with to create sustainable, stylish clothes that blend traditional Palestinian designs with modern, fashionable cuts that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a Scandinavian storefront.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8b5c7ccc25bab24a2457068d1c8dd2f204adaa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8b5c7ccc25bab24a2457068d1c8dd2f204adaa3/0_0_3000_4000/750.jpg\" alt=\"A striped suit look from N\u00f6l Collective\u2019s autumn/winter 2023 collection.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A striped suit look from N\u00f6l Collective\u2019s autumn/winter 2023 collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg C. Holland/PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nol, which means \u201cloom\u201d in Arabic, was born out of the ashes of a previous project which was also founded out of a desire for community, following Mjalli\u2019s experiences of sexual harassment. In 2017, she began hosting support workshops for women who had experienced abuse, as well as selling T-shirts with feminist slogans such as \u201cnot your habibti\u201d \u2013 habibti means \u201cmy love\u201d \u2013 through Instagram. After a couple of years, a thorny question arose: how feminist could the initiative be if they knew nothing about who had made the T-shirts, where the fabric had come from, or how much the garment workers \u2013 80% of whom are women \u2013 are being paid?</p> <p>\u201cFashion is inherently political, whether or not it\u2019s being produced in Palestine,\u201d Mjalli tells me over the phone from London, where the lookbook for the latest collection was shot by Greg C Holland of SkatePal, a not-for-profit organisation supporting young people in Palestine. \u201cThis generation is more open to that idea because it\u2019s inextricably connected with climate change, but how can we take that one step further \u2013 how it intersects with women, or with labour conditions, or with economic frameworks,\u201d she says. \u201cThe goal is to have customers thinking about fashion in an intersectional framework, to realise there is more than one element to this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c35345772dd5e5937f367e0c8488d55963e4eeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c35345772dd5e5937f367e0c8488d55963e4eeb/0_0_3283_2433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The clothes are made using indigenous natural dyes and finished with traditional designs such as the Unesco-recognised art of Palestinian embroidery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Tatreez\u2019 and natural dyes \u2026 making the clothes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yasmeen Mjalli/PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The clothes themselves are made using indigenous natural dyes and finished with traditional designs such as <em>tatreez, </em>the Unesco-recognised art of Palestinian embroidery, which began as a way for women to signal their marital status or regional origin but became a political symbol of resistance and displacement following the Nakba (the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the Arab-Israeli war) in 1948. When the Palestinian flag was banned in 1980, women began embroidering the colours into their dresses in defiance. Today, it remains largely a women\u2019s craft, passed down from mother to daughter, despite attempts at commercialisation and appropriation by Israeli designers.</p> <p>The latest collection features bright pops of colour amid soft greens and neutrals: slouchy cotton twill cargo pants made in Askar refugee camp, on the outskirts of the West Bank city of Nablus; vibrant hand-woven wool shoulder bags made by mothers and daughters in al Khalil (Hebron); and hand-embroidered tank tops made in a solar-powered workshop in Bethlehem. Prices start at around $48 or \u00a337.</p> <p>With the exception of the weavers in Gaza, Mjalli doesn\u2019t work with anyone unless she has met them in person and learned about their work first-hand. She counts all the tailors, producers, embroiderers and weavers who create N\u00f6l\u2019s clothes as friends; they eat meals together and share gifts at Eid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de6bbb02d2ed505f4c40a540ad066b0aa1ab6461\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de6bbb02d2ed505f4c40a540ad066b0aa1ab6461/0_0_3000_4000/750.jpg\" alt=\"A pink sweatshirt and khaki green trousers from N\u00f6l Collective\u2019s autumn/winter 2023 collection.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pink sweatshirt and khaki green trousers from N\u00f6l Collective\u2019s autumn/winter 2023 collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg C. Holland/PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To create the garments, Mjalli partners directly with local women\u2019s cooperatives, family-run sewing workshops, and artisans, keeping production hyper-local and traceable. In the absence of a centralised directory, she relies on word of mouth for introduction to the women she works with, with relationships being forged over the course of years. The process is synergetic. \u201cIt\u2019s a production-oriented design process; sometimes it\u2019s collaborative, and sometimes it\u2019s absolutely just [the women] telling me: \u2018This is what you designed, and we like this better,\u2019\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cIt is driven by what they\u2019re able to do and what they want to do.\u201d</p> <p>The production process is inextricably tied to the realities of Palestinian life under Israeli occupation. On the day of our call, three Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during a raid on the city of Nablus, near one of the sewing workshops N\u00f6l works with. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with tailors whose nephews had been murdered, or women whose daughters had fiances murdered,\u201d says Mjalli in a matter-of-fact tone. \u201cThese are the realities that we\u2019re facing.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, her mother had called to let her know that the checkpoint she was planning to cross the following day to pick up some finished pieces from the Nablus workshop had been closed . \u201cThere\u2019s a shooting, immediately the checkpoint closes, blockades go up, and suddenly what would be an hour and a half drive is three or four hours \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky and the border even opens at all,\u201d she sighs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3eed1163d62c20a45664fe5945d46605abd687f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3eed1163d62c20a45664fe5945d46605abd687f/0_0_3000_4000/750.jpg\" alt=\"A green waistcoat from N\u00f6l Collective\u2019s autumn/winter 2023 collection.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A green waistcoat from N\u00f6l Collective\u2019s autumn/winter 2023 collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yasmeen Mjalli/PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Naturally, this can affect shipping, and many garments are available only for pre-order with an estimated shipping date that is often subject to change, depending on what is happening on the ground. \u201cOur customer [base] is very diverse \u2013 it\u2019s not just Arabs, it\u2019s not just the Palestinian diaspora. It\u2019s actually mostly non-Arabs in the US and UK, which is incredible,\u201d says Mjalli. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to foster such a unique community of people who are now engaging in consumerism in a way that I think they\u2019re not really getting to do with any other brands.\u201d For many, it has been a lesson in both the logistics of slow fashion and the realities of life in occupied Palestine.</p> <p>Ultimately, Mjalli\u2019s intention is, perhaps surprisingly, for N\u00f6l Collective to eventually stop making clothes. \u201cThe goal is to keep storytelling more than anything else,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that, up until now, fashion, and the garments, have been the medium through which we\u2019re telling our stories about the Palestinian people, about the land, about sustainability and what that looks like for non-western people especially. The people we work with have so much more support from the community that we\u2019ve built in terms of transparency and building connections. Hopefully, we can move on to storytelling in other mediums \u2013 there\u2019s only so many sweatshirts that I feel comfortable trying to sell.\u201d</p>"

    "content": "<p>Our wedding started and ended at our house. I like my home comforts and, despite my husband\u2019s previous protestations that we were not having an afterparty, one nevertheless unfolded in our living room. </p> <p>The photographer ventured into the garden. It was mid-April, a far nicer day than we\u2019d dared hope for, and the tulips were out. We went on our honeymoon afterwards; had she not taken photos of them, I would have missed the lot.</p> <p>I enjoy a tulip. Easily identified, pleasingly reliable, come in every colour under the sun: no wonder they\u2019ve got their own emoji. It feels as if they\u2019ve had a particularly florid few years, encouraged, I think, by the pandemic and our desperate need for something, anything, that offered a brief hit of joy. If you were clever enough to plant some in autumn 2019, you would have enjoyed a colourful riot as lockdown set in. If, like me, you weren\u2019t (I\u2019d expected to have moved out of my balcony flat by then), you may have become dependent on your local florist.</p> <p>If you would rather have some in your garden, you may be able to buy potted tulips that are gearing up to flower over the next few weeks. It\u2019s a quick fix but expensive, and one I\u2019d recommend you resist so that you can spend your flower funds on bulbs come August instead, when you can order exactly what you like and in great quantity for only a few pence per bulb.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s normal to ask a\u00a0grocer or butcher where our food comes from \u2013 we should do the same with flowers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tulips are best planted from November onwards (mine went in days before Christmas last year), where, in either the pots or the ground, they will gradually emerge with delicious anticipation before exploding for a few weeks. They like a sunny spot but they last longer with a little shade and will put up with more of it than people realise; they\u2019re also very tolerant of containers as long as they\u2019re not subjected to waterlogged soil.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t time for potted tulips, now is a good time to make a friend of your florist \u2013 especially if they grow or stock British-grown flowers. You can pick up bunches of supermarket tulips cheaply at the moment, but that\u2019s because they are grown in water, under LED lights, rather than in the soil under daylight. Swaddled in single-use plastic, these bargain blooms lack the size, colour variation and beauty of those from more sustainable farms. A sustainably grown tulip will dwarf a supermarket one, with supermodel-leggy stems and generous, teacup-sized flowers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/03/dwarf-irises-bring-colour-and-glamour-to-the-start-of-spring\">Dwarf irises bring colour and glamour to the start of spring</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has become normal to ask our grocer or butcher where our food comes from, but we rarely do it with flowers \u2013 and we should, as they can have an equally daunting carbon footprint. But there\u2019s also an unbeatable elegance to consciously grown, seasonal flowers. Not only are you buying them at their best, but they fade with style, too. We\u2019ve thankfully moved away from the trend for stiff, straight stems and towards a more natural celebration of Dutch master-like opulence. When I have tulips in a vase, I enjoy them until every petal curls up and drifts towards the tabletop, their bright colours vanishing into deeper, beautiful decay.</p>"

Cullen said Barclay had replied to a letter from her half an hour before her appearance on the Kuenssberg show, but that it said \u201cvery little\u201d.</p> \n<p>Speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, the Conservative party chair, Greg Hands, called the rejected offer to nurses \u201cfull and final\u201d but dodged questions on what action might follow.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe are waiting for the other results to come in from the other unions. It\u2019s only reasonable for us during the middle of the balloting process to wait to see those further results and we\u2019ll be laying out a response.\u201d</p> \n<p>After RCN members voted by 54% to 46% to reject the government\u2019s offer of a 5% pay rise this year and a cash payment for last year, the union announced a new 48-hour strike starting on 30 April.</p> \n<p>RCN members would then be balloted on further strikes, Cullen said: \u201cAnd if that ballot is successful, it will mean further strike action, right up until Christmas.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cullen defended the plan to escalate the type of action, meaning areas such as accident and emergency and cancer care would not be excluded from new strikes.</p> \n<p>Asked why this was happening, she said: \u201cBecause this government has not listened. That\u2019s that, frankly, the answer to that.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis government can\u2019t say, on the one hand we value nurses so much that they shouldn\u2019t go on strike, and then we don\u2019t value the value them enough to pay them. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the crisis we\u2019re in.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/12/strike-calendar/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, the membership body for the health service across the UK, said the possibility of combined industrial action would see the NHS enter \u201cuncharted territory\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe people that I represent will have to spend a great deal of time doing the detailed planning, the detailed negotiation with trade unions locally to try to ensure that we protect life and limb,\u201d he told the Ridge show.</p> \n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22053091/steve-barclay-patients-at-risk-nurses-strike/\">article for the Sun on Sunday</a>, Barclay praised members of Unison, another union representing NHS staff, for accepting the pay offer, and warned that more strikes could harm patient safety.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, castigated Barclay for writing in the Sun on Sunday rather than engaging with unions, telling the Ridge show: \u201cThere\u2019s no point writing to a newspaper like an agony aunt. You\u2019re the health secretary, show some leadership.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he also urged the RCN to not escalate its method of striking: \u201cI think one of the reasons why the RCN has enjoyed widespread public support is that in previous rounds of industrial action they have gone out of their way to say, we\u2019re going to protect emergency care, we\u2019re going to protect cancer care. And I\u2019m deeply worried about the escalation of the nature of their dispute.\u201d</p>"

    "content": "<p>Brett Chedzoy and his wife, Maria, live on a 300-acre farm in Watkins Glen, a small town along the Finger Lakes in New York, with 100 cows \u2013 primarily Black Angus, with a few White Galloways scattered throughout the herd.</p> <p>The farm, Angus Glen, has lush green pastures and wooded areas, where black walnut and black locust trees stretch skyward out of rolling seas of tall grasses, shrubs and clovers. When Chedzoy, 54, walks through the pasture at sunset, the cows pop their heads up, follow him and wait patiently at the gate. As he pulls it aside, the cows rush forward into the wooded area to nibble on tree branches and shrubs, before turning their attention to the emerald grass around the trees.</p> <p>Here, the cows don\u2019t only live on pastures, as you\u2019d expect \u2013 they also live in the woods.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you move into a fresh paddock, it\u2019s fun to watch them for the first five minutes because they\u2019ll walk over and they\u2019ll take a little bit of this and a little bit of that,\u201d said Chedzoy, also an agroforestry educator at the Cornell Cooperative Extension. \u201cThey instantly know that\u2019s good for me, that\u2019s not good for me \u2013 they\u2019re self-medicating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab4c38706c504703682e416d2ea050ed7c4d549a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab4c38706c504703682e416d2ea050ed7c4d549a/0_0_3600_2394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aberdeen Angus cattle graze at Angus Glen Farms, in Watkins Glen, upstate New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aberdeen Angus cattle graze at Angus Glen Farms, in Watkins Glen, upstate New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heather Ainsworth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s an old farming technique called silvopasture, in which cattle graze on a variety of plants, either in forests that have been thinned and planted with grasses and shrubs, or pastureland that\u2019s been planted with widely spaced trees.</p> <p>Considered better for the environment and less emissions-intensive than most other forms of cattle production, silvopasture is seeing a resurgence around the world with major efforts to expand its usage in Canada, Brazil and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7822241/\">the Mediterranean</a>. And now, in part through Chedzoy\u2019s work, in the US as well.</p> <p>Chedzoy first learned about silvopasture while serving in the Peace Corps in Argentina in the early 1990s. Beef is a staple of the diet there, but cattle are also used to provide key fire-prevention services by grazing away potential fuel in forests.</p> <p>\u201cThat opened my mind,\u201d said Chedzoy.</p> <p>When he moved back to New York, on to poor-quality farmland that his father had bought years before, he and Maria wanted to use the land. Not satisfied with the quality or price of grocery store beef, they started with just two cows and their calves in 2003. As the herd grew, he ran out of space in the old dairy barn he\u2019d been using to hold them in winter. The solution was raising them on silvopasture instead.</p> <p>Rather than building another barn, he started using forests as a natural shelter to keep his cows protected from the wind and snow in winter, and the heat of sunshine the summer. In addition to saving him money, doing so has been <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-abstract/79/9/2327/4645232?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false\">found</a> to help cattle reach their target body weight quicker than those in direct sun, since they need to spend less energy on regulating their body temperature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6b02dc4c6e62e068149a1e878b58fa2c5ef35d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6b02dc4c6e62e068149a1e878b58fa2c5ef35d6/222_0_3283_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chedzoy comforts a newborn calf at his farm in Watkins Glen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chedzoy comforts a newborn calf at his farm in Watkins Glen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heather Ainsworth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are many other benefits to silvopasture for cattle, farmers and ecosystems.</p> <p>Silvopasture gives cows choice in where to be and what to eat, which Karolini Tenffen de Sousa, a postdoctoral fellow at Instituto de Zootecnia in Brazil who specializes in cattle behavior, says can improve their health. Cows can be in the shade when they want, drink water when they want, and graze when they want. \u201cIf they don\u2019t experience stress their physiology will be good,\u201d she said.</p> <p>According to a 2017 study from the Center for Agroforestry at the University of Missouri, silvopasture can also extend the grazing season, so that it starts earlier in spring and lasts longer in fall compared to open pasture. Forage also grows better in silvopastures during the hottest times of the summer compared to open pasture, the study found.</p> <p>\u201cThe silvopastures are gold during droughts,\u201d Chedzoy said. \u201cThe plants don\u2019t wither and burn up like they do in the shadeless pastures.\u201d</p> <p>Chedzoy says the cows\u2019 diet of grass, forage and hay that he harvests in the summer means he doesn\u2019t need to supplement his feed with protein meal or additional roughage the way many farmers do. And having the cows spread out across the forest all year long \u2013 instead of being stuck in a barn during the winter \u2013 means their waste doesn\u2019t pollute the local watershed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bb9bfded8f327015fe1c596fe263ebe788ec60ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb9bfded8f327015fe1c596fe263ebe788ec60ca/0_0_3600_2438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cow and her calf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silvopasture can also extend the grazing season, so that it starts earlier in spring and lasts longer in fall compared to open pasture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heather Ainsworth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And silvopasture allows for many layers of biodiversity compared to grasslands. They support a wider variety of bird species, more pollinators, bigger and more diverse mammals, and a much wider variety of plant life with more varied root systems.</p> <p>But it also requires careful management and daily rotation, as livestock can damage trees by trampling roots. This wear and tear can go unnoticed for years, and once the damage is visible, it can be too late to save those valuable trees.</p> <p>While research is still in early stages, <a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/silvopasture\">Project Drawdown</a>, a leading organization promoting climate solutions, has heralded silvopasture as an agricultural solution to the climate crisis due to hopes it can increase carbon sequestration through plants pulling <a href=\"https://extension.psu.edu/what-do-forest-carbon-sequestration-and-storage-mean#:~:text=Carbon%20sequestration%20is%20the%20creation,a%20byproduct%20of%20this%20process.\">carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis</a>, sinking it into soils, and holding it in their own biomass.</p> <p>Alix Contosta, a research assistant professor at University of New Hampshire who focuses on the relationship between land use and climate, says that her research has shown that carbon and nitrous oxide emissions were lower in silvopastures compared to areas that were clear cut or in treeless pasture, meaning cattle on silvopasture has lower emissions. In addition, most silvopastures, like Chedzoy\u2019s, don\u2019t require emissions-intensive fertilizers or feed that has to be grown and shipped to the farm, further reducing the impact on the climate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65e2a112b4e2461969f40d4f9e0e423fa9d81a79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65e2a112b4e2461969f40d4f9e0e423fa9d81a79/0_0_3600_2391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"man with cows behind him\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brett Chedzoy: \u2018We can grow more of what we need in our own backyards.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heather Ainsworth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But farmers often need support in getting silvopastures off the ground. Some experts point out that while there is federal funding available to help farmers start silvopastures, it\u2019s often difficult to access because of bureaucratic red tape and the time-consuming application process.</p> <p>Still, the technique is gaining popularity. Chedzoy has been encouraged by the increasing popularity of his courses and trainings and by young farmers following in his footsteps who are committed to regenerating their land with agroforestry.</p> <p>Katherine Carestio considers him a mentor. She\u2019s a young farmer who first encountered silvopasture at Angus Glen. She now runs Backbone Farm in Trumansburg, New York. Along with her husband Jamie, she owns a small herd of Red Devons mixed with Chedzoy\u2019s Black Angus. She said Chedzoy helped them set up their farm and silvopasture, guiding them through questions about infrastructure and management and lending them a bull before they got their own.</p> <p>In the last two decades, Chedzoy has watched silvopasture go from something nearly unheard of in the region, to a much discussed climate solution. He sees a future with hundreds of thousands of acres of silvopasture in New York. \u201cWe can grow more of what we need in our own backyards,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd do it in a way that\u2019s a win-win for the environment and the animals and the farms and even the whole community.\u201d</p>"

    "content": "<p>Tinned, smoked, barbecued, or fried and squashed into a buttered bap \u2013 mackerel is one of the UK\u2019s most versatile and affordable fish. And this seemingly abundant species has been widely touted as a top sustainable choice for seafood-lovers looking for a dose of omega-3.</p> <p>Not any more. The UK\u2019s Marine Conservation Society (MCS) recently <a href=\"https://media.mcsuk.org/documents/Mackerel_no_longer_sustainable_choice_says_environmental_charity.pdf\">downgraded</a> the sustainability rating of north-east Atlantic mackerel, moving it from the \u201cgreen\u201d to the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/species/mackerel/?search=mackerel\">amber\u201d list</a> on its Good Fish Guide.</p> <p>But what prompted this decision? What should consumers do with this information? And are there any other sources of sustainable healthy fish oils?</p> <h2>Why has mackerel been downgraded?</h2> <p>In a nutshell: the main problem is governments aren\u2019t good at sharing fishing quotas and have heaped pressure on mackerel populations in recent years.</p> <p>The UK is one of 17 nations \u2013 including Iceland, Norway and several countries in the EU \u2013 that catch tonnes of mackerel from the north-east Atlantic annually. Stocks are assessed every few years by the <a href=\"https://www.ices.dk/Pages/default.aspx\">International Council for the Exploration of the Sea</a> (ICES), which then sets advisory catch limits to protect numbers.</p> <p>While most countries agree on the scientific limit, they do not agree on how to share it, meaning that overall catches exceed the advised amount. The 17 mackerel-fishing countries have overstepped the ICES\u2019s threshold by <a href=\"https://www.hafogvatn.is/en/about/news-announcements/ices-fishery-advice-on-widely-distributed-pelagic-fish-stocks-for-2023\">41% on average</a> since 2010.</p> <p>There are some other contributing factors. Mackerel numbers have been declining since 2015 partly due to fewer young mackerel surviving to adulthood. This could be due to changing ocean temperatures, less available prey and disease. But this, alongside countries\u2019 catch rates, is spelling trouble for mackerel numbers.</p> <p>This year, states were supposed to remedy overfishing by agreeing how to divide the mackerel catch fairly. But a March 2023 meeting<a href=\"https://napafisheries.org/blown-it-coastal-states-spectacularly-fail-to-meet-their-own-deadline-to-agree-shares-on-northeast-atlantic-mackerel/\"> ended with no agreement</a> \u2013 leaving mackerel exposed yet again.</p> <p>Following this impasse, the MCS imposed its \u201camber\u201d rating to spur action.</p> <h2>To eat, or not to eat?</h2> <p>Protecting this species from decline is important. Economically, Atlantic mackerel accounts for 32% of the UK\u2019s fishing catch, according to the MCS, making it essential for those whose livelihoods rely on fishing. Sharks, whales, dolphins and dozens of other species also depend on rich mackerel shoals for food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1041f0038dddfd05ab91171bb3cd0f59e1ae8538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1041f0038dddfd05ab91171bb3cd0f59e1ae8538/0_0_4896_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mackerel fishing is vital for the UK industry, while the fish also feeds dozens of maritime species.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mackerel fishing is vital for the UK industry, while the fish also feeds dozens of maritime species.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andia/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>So should we curb our consumption?</h2> <p>Not entirely. Charlotte Coombes, Good Fish Guide manager at the MCS, says: \u201cMackerel is amber-rated, and an amber rating means try to find a more sustainable option if you can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore sustainable\u201d here can mean two things. First, mackerel lovers could buy their fish from lower-impact sources such as <a href=\"https://www.linecaught.org.uk/about/about-mackerel/\">line-caught mackerel fisheries</a>, says Coombes. These catches are more controlled than other methods, and some handline fisheries also stick to strict catch limits and <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/ratings/wild-capture/193/\">protect young mackerel</a>.</p> <p>Diversifying your diet is also a good habit generally. \u201cThere are loads more seafood options out there,\u201d says Coombes. \u201cSometimes it just means being a little bit creative and perhaps trying something new. But it\u2019s a way to spread the burden on our oceans.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/species/european-anchovy/\">European anchovies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/species/sardine/\">sardines</a> are both rich in omega-3 and the Good Fish Guide greenlights these as alternatives to Atlantic mackerel. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that ratings vary by individual fisheries, so it is always handy to know exactly where your fish comes from.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/26/north-east-atlantic-overfishing-brexit\">Atlantic overfishing was already a problem. Then Brexit happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More generally, \u201csustainability\u201d is a shifting concept. For example, the ICES assesses more than 200 species of fish in the north-east Atlantic alone, and the statuses of these can change over time depending on various factors, says Ewen Bell, a UK member of the ICES Advisory Committee.</p> <p>Keeping abreast of changes through seafood apps such as the <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/ocean-emergency/sustainable-seafood/the-good-fish-guide/add-the-good-fish-guide-to-your-phone/\">Good Fish Guide</a> and MSC\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.msc.org/en-au/what-we-are-doing/our-approach/the-msc-blue-fish-tick\">blue tick</a>\u201d labels on fish is currently the best bet for making sustainable choices.</p> <h2>What\u2019s next for mackerel?</h2> <p>North Atlantic fishing countries will need to agree on how to split the catch before the MCS will consider greenlighting mackerel again, says Coombes.</p> <p>Momentum for change is growing among seafood companies and retailers. The <a href=\"https://napafisheries.org/\">North Atlantic Pelagic Advocacy Group</a> \u2013 an initiative that includes Asda, Waitrose, M&amp;S and the Co-op \u2013 has pushed for better mackerel management since 2019.</p> <p>Meanwhile, consumers shouldn\u2019t underestimate the power of their choices. Coombes says: \u201cWe know that supermarkets and restaurants do pay attention when people ask where\u2019s my fish from? If they get the message that people care about that, they will start looking at their own sourcing policies more carefully.\u201d</p>"

This is the highest railway station in the UK and the next day we board the West Highland Line (recently equipped with a dedicated bike carriage) for the picturesque ride to Spean Bridge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d0531803bbd3499ecf4bd7cda5696d5752e35f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d0531803bbd3499ecf4bd7cda5696d5752e35f7/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trees for Life Estate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One of Wilderness Scotland\u2019s partners is <a href=\"https://treesforlife.org.uk/\">Trees for Life</a>, which is working to rewild the Highlands and restore the Caledonian Forest. Before our train back home we visit the flagship Dundreggan estate \u2013 where the UK\u2019s first rewilding centre will open in March. We tour the tree nurseries and walk through the beech forests, learning where natural regeneration works and where reforestation is needed.</p> <p>It\u2019s an interesting end to a whirlwind long weekend that has shown how travel can educate, excite and be fun, with minimal impact on the planet. Carbon emissions for a trip such as ours would be around 38kg a person for three days (including everything from accommodation to food, but not the train up), says Ben, when the average CO2 a person a day in the UK is 15kg. Not all itineraries can have such a light footprint, of course, but it\u2019s an inspiring step in the right direction.</p> <p><em>The trip was provided by <a href=\"http://www.wildernessscotland.com/\">Wilderness Scotland</a>, wh</em><em>ich offers a range of low-carbon guided and self-guided holidays </em><em>that incorporate sustainable accommodation and experiences. </em><em>Prices on the <a href=\"http://sleeper.scot/\">Caledonian Sleeper</a> from London Euston to Inverness or Aviemore start from </em><em>\u00a355</em><em> for a </em><em>seat, classic rooms from \u00a3</em><em>205</em><em> for two, Club rooms from </em><em>\u00a3255</em><em> for two</em></p>"

But part of the big attraction of Denmark and its people comes through their philosophy of respect for nature and their abundance of hygge, in the main being happy for others and letting them just be.</p> <p>On a broad bay in the country\u2019s Djursland peninsula sits the pretty coastal town of Ebeltoft, surrounded by the green hills and bronze age burial mounds of the <a href=\"https://www.visitaarhus.com/aarhus-region/plan-your-trip/mols-bjerge-national-park-gdk935587\">Mols Bjerge national park</a>. All cobbled streets and creaking half-timbered houses painted in lovely pastel shades, it buzzes with families on a long weekend break. There are opportunities for days splashing in the cool waters of the Baltic sea, windy walks on the harbour, visiting tall Viking ships and taking cycle rides along the many signposted paths. It is picture perfect holiday fodder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e969b90052a301c4757ff86c4d0dfe9ec189f657\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e969b90052a301c4757ff86c4d0dfe9ec189f657/0_69_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ebeltoft on the Djursland peninsula is close to Aarhus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ebeltoft on the Djursland peninsula is close to Aarhus</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visit Arhus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But just on the outskirts of this impeccably charming Danish town is another, little-known tourist attraction. Sitting off a busy main road is the sustainable community of <a href=\"https://start.friland.org/\">Friland</a>, an eco-community where all the inhabitants have built their own homes with the hope of living mortgage-free. The idea started as a Big Brother-esque experiment on Denmark\u2019s national television station DR-TV two decades ago. It featured 13 families who left behind their busy lives and transformed a small village with back-to-basics living as the prerequisite.</p> <p>The reality is that not all the residents stayed \u2013 some were unable to finish their homes, others no longer wanted to be part of the experiment \u2013 but many thrived. Houses were made of straw bales, wooden planks and other natural and recyclable materials such as seashells and sawdust, and the programme was a hit. Long after the cameras left, the community continued to grow and it has now become a blueprint for cooperative, simple living.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>This is Grand Designs but without the cash and fanfare, with a common, shared goal at its heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>About 2,000 tourists visit every year, with guided tours conducted by residents from May to October showing how the 45 families live. One of the residents who conducts these tours is Nikolai, 44, a former boarding school teacher who moved into the community five years ago with his family. He is building a home inspired by African architecture \u2013 organic and playful, it has a beech tree running through its centre and will be painted with a lime and yoghurt mix instead of render.</p> <p>\u201cI became interested in the idea about 10 years ago \u2013 the thought of building my own home, living sustainably and without a mortgage was a dream for us,\u201d says Nikolai. \u201cIt has given us a quality of life that we never thought we could have and we want to share that with others, to show them that it is something everyone can achieve.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bfb969057f4958cb9458620035843eb34be1ce1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bfb969057f4958cb9458620035843eb34be1ce1/0_0_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Friland is an eco-community where people live mortgage-free.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Friland is an eco-community where people live mortgage-free.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Halse</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The caveat for living in the community is that residents cannot have a mortgage so need to save the money to build their own home. One man lived in a caravan for 13 years before building his home and others have come up with innovative ideas to build on minuscule budgets \u2013 including a home in the community which is fully insulated with wine corks. The residents make a living in a variety of interesting ways. One couple started a permaculture \u2013 or sustainably high yield farm- on the site with other residents paying them to grow produce. There are ceramicists, joiners, embroiderers \u2013 all of whom sell their goods.</p> <p>\u201cIn every family there is usually one person who is making something or running a business,\u201d says Nikolai. \u201cIt is between a collective and a village \u2013 we all have a skill that we can then share.\u201d</p> <p>It is inspiring. This is Grand Designs but without the cash and fanfare, with a common, shared goal at its heart \u2013 mainly to live without debt, but also to create a way of living that has very little impact on the environment and that brings people together. There is a volunteer-based grocery store and cafe on site; a shed containing clothes which are free; and the community hold an evening once a month where they all eat together. There is also an annual general assembly meeting where residents decide on projects they might want to initiate for the following year. All perfect ingredients for a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d20398ff9a3e390ac3f038c8606ec90a32b93f21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d20398ff9a3e390ac3f038c8606ec90a32b93f21/0_113_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Restaurant Moment is run by former residents of Friland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Restaurant Moment is run by former residents of Friland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Somewhat surprisingly there is a fine dining eatery, <a href=\"https://www.restaurantmoment.dk/\">Restaurant Moment</a>, at the entrance to the village.

    "content": "<p>What do you do if you\u2019re a designer who is trying to be more sustainable but you want to show at fashion week? For Emilie Helmstedt, a Danish designer who took part in last week\u2019s Copenhagen fashion week, the solution for the footwear styled with her dresses came from her team who brought in their old Nike and Adidas trainers. Covering them with ribbons, beads and paint, Helmstedt decided it was better than using new versions, as she has done in the past. It also chimed with the rest of the collection \u2013 her finale look which was made from scraps of material accumulated in her studio.</p> <p>Copenhagen fashion week started in 2006 with relatively low-level fanfare. Then, three years ago, Danish organisers set out a series of sustainability requirements for designers to meet in order to be allowed to show in 2023 which would set them apart from the main fashion weeks \u2013 New York, Milan, Paris and London \u2013 on the global calendar</p> <p>Based on the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\">United Nations sustainable development goals</a>, the organisers decided on 18 requirements that would apply to the event itself, as well as to all designers<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>who wanted to participate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1042e82dadbb7109e316846c535cd923efc01fdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1042e82dadbb7109e316846c535cd923efc01fdd/0_0_3403_5105/667.jpg\" alt=\"A model on the runway at the Ganni AW23 show at Copenhagen fashion week.

The brand is one of Denmark\u2019s most successful fashion labels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Anderson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had a clear idea of what I wanted to do differently. It was about time to set specific requirements rather than just give guidelines,\u201d says Cecilie Thorsmark, the chief executive officer of Copenhagen fashion week (CPHFW) who outlined these requirements, which include a rule that 50% of a collection must be made using textiles from new generation materials such as <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/new-sustainable-materials\">alternatives to animal-derived raw materials</a> like leather. Deadstock, recycled or upcycled materials are also encouraged.</p> <p>Most brands have dropped fur from collections but, here, fur is banned outright and any unsold stock from previous collections cannot be destroyed \u2013 the most prevalent technique, burning and slashing items, was employed by brands <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jul/20/why-does-burberry-destroy-its-products-q-and-a\">including Burberry</a> in the past. Instead, brands are to sell to discount outlets such as TK Maxx or enter them into the circular economy. Brands must also ensure, by exercising due diligence and working with suppliers, that chains are free from child labour and factories provide safe and fair working conditions.</p> <p>Thorsmark, who previously worked for the Global Fashion Agenda, an industry group focused on sustainability, says she took the job in 2018 to challenge both the role and purpose of fashion week. </p> <p>Implementing the requirements was a risk. CPHFW didn\u2019t want to lose the bigger commercial names such as Ganni that attract international press and buyers. Thirty brands were approached with 28 qualifying three years later. Applications were first reviewed by a show committee made up of industry experts, then reviewed and verified by Ramboll, an external consultancy company.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"681b46cc09fb5949a50de6b6190ddaf90a60ccee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/681b46cc09fb5949a50de6b6190ddaf90a60ccee/0_0_4098_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sequins on the Stine Goya AW23 runway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sequins on the Stine Goya AW23 runway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Cochrane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One brand dropped out of the process halfway through while another was rejected after failing to meet all 18 obligations (Thorsmark wouldn\u2019t reveal which brand it was). </p> <p>On paper, it\u2019s encouraging news from what is often considered the fifth fashion week. But despite the changes many remain sceptical.</p> <p>Ciara Barry, policy and campaigns manager at the non-profit Fashion Revolution, is <a href=\"https://www.goodclothesfairpay.eu/\">currently mandating for living wage legislation across the fashion sector</a>. She says it is concerning that the requirements don\u2019t even mention fair pay. \u201cThere is an inherent hypocrisy with a glamorous fashion show displaying collections which are made in poverty. All players in the fashion industry should call for systemic change \u2013 and fashion weeks have a role to play in this.\u201d</p> <p>Barry says the omission also highlights the challenges that independent brands face from larger fast-fashion brands. \u201cThe nature of fashion\u2019s supply chains make it incredibly difficult for individual brands to ensure living wages on their own,\u201d says Barry. \u201cThey all share factories and suppliers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55b65c857d34931ad437801631ec5feec402400b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55b65c857d34931ad437801631ec5feec402400b/0_0_4253_6379/667.jpg\" alt=\"Henrik Vibskov, a designer who has been showing for more than two decades, felt the requirements finally acknowledged the steps he has been trying to implement since 2016.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henrik Vibskov, a designer who has been showing for more than two decades, felt the requirements finally acknowledged the steps he has been trying to implement since 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Anderson/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there are the double standards around offsetting carbon emissions. In order to meet the zero waste requirement, brands sent digital QR codes in place of embossed paper invitations. Single-use plastic was banned, show sets were minimal and all props had to be reused. Meanwhile, members of the press and fashion buyers flew in from around the world to look at even more new clothing that was being produced.</p> <p>On the ground, the designers themselves were mainly optimistic about the changes. Henrik Vibskov, who has been showing for more than two decades, felt the requirements finally acknowledged the steps he has been trying to implement since 2016. \u201cEverything has a life after its first use,\u201d he said as he described his basement filled with archive pieces. His latest set featuring paper tomato trees is next going to be exhibited in Berlin.</p> <p>For (di)vision\u2019s co-founders, the siblings Simon and Nanna Wick \u201ccreating from what already is\u201d has been their ethos since they founded their streetwear inspired brand in 2018. To them, working with almost exclusively deadstock and upcycling materials is \u201ca no brainer.\u201d</p> <p>They also source their fabrics from suppliers in Italy, often using \u201cwaste material\u201d from giant retailers or design houses. Wick says he managed to trace the fabric used for a faux-fur vest back to a collection from Stella McCartney, while a shirt featuring red wine stains was made from an old table cloth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb080b9702cee245c35051ae2473e4fe28c2a506\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb080b9702cee245c35051ae2473e4fe28c2a506/0_0_2732_4098/667.jpg\" alt=\"(di)vision upcycled old table cloths featuring red wine stains\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">(di)vision upcycled old table cloths featuring red wine stains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Cochrane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seemed a trickier area to navigate for the more commercially successful Scandi brands such as Stine Goya, Ganni and Rotate. Known for their signature sparkly dresses and accessories, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64056052\">sequins which have devastating environmental consequences</a> continued to appear multiple times. Rotate claims its versions are sustainable as they are recycled. Ganni say it uses 100% recycled polyester sequins on a 100% recycled polyester backing. A spokesperson for Stine Goya said that it uses some recycled polyester versions and its team are looking for more sustainable options.</p> <p>Charlotte Eskildsen, co-founder of the Danish label The Garment, thinks it\u2019s about phrasing \u2013 and that the word sustainable itself is problematic. She prefers the word \u201cresponsible\u201d. \u201cFashion is never going to be sustainable and we know that we are contributing to an industry that is polluting way more than it should,\u201d adds (di)vision\u2019s Wick.</p> <p>While Oslo and Helsinki fashion weeks have already <a href=\"https://www.voguescandinavia.com/articles/an-exclusive-first-look-at-oslo-runways-upcoming-program\">implemented Copenhagen\u2019s framework</a>, with New York\u2019s fashion week kicking off many were hopeful that the noise generated by CPHFW could spark wider change, or at least conversation. Caroline Rush, CEO of the British Fashion Council, says London fashion week won\u2019t be following suit. \u201cThe event hosts a mixture of established and emerging brands and as result of this setting a one-size-fits-all sustainability standard is not feasible without alienating the smaller businesses.\u201d Instead the BFC says it encourages brands to commit to voluntary initiatives such as joining the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/\">UN\u2019s Climate Challenge</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac42cc194faa79734a2060dd2ed8e594c8f88b06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac42cc194faa79734a2060dd2ed8e594c8f88b06/0_0_2732_4098/667.jpg\" alt=\"Amalie R\u00f8ge Hove now uses 30 percent recycled nylon in her designs while she looks for an eco alternative\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amalie R\u00f8ge Hove now uses 30 percent recycled nylon in her designs while she looks for an eco alternative.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Cochrane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fiona Gooch, a senior policy adviser at the fair trade organisation <a href=\"https://www.transform-trade.org/\">Transform Trade</a>, says both an EU regulator and a fashion watchdog <a href=\"https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3320/news\">as proposed in UK parliament </a>is a better option. \u201cThe actions of large brands cause poverty wages and unsafe conditions and undermine smaller fashion brands who regularly use the same suppliers.\u201d</p> <p>Barry adds: \u201cThe Copenhagen fashion week requirements are absolutely better than nothing, but all fashion shows should move forward by introducing sustainability standards that advance further \u2013 they could really drive meaningful change in doing so.\u201d</p> <p>Thorsmark says: \u201cIf we rewind three years ago, not a single brand met any of the 18 requirements. Now they do so we will push them again to continue improving.\u201d</p>"

The Lionesses appeared strong enough to seriously challenge for football\u2019s biggest prize.</p> <p>The loss of the Euro 2022 Golden Boot and Golden Ball winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/22/england-and-arsenals-beth-mead-set-for-long-absence-due-to-knee-injury\" title=\"\">Beth Mead with an anterior cruciate ligament injury</a> that would almost certainly end her World Cup dream was a blow, but one that could be taken; the depth was there.

All that remained of England\u2019s European Championship spine, with the retirement of the striker Ellen White, was the goalkeeper Mary Earps and the defensive midfielder Keira Walsh.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2023/aug/21/england-womens-world-cup-journey-photos-from-inside-the-camp\">England Women\u2019s World Cup journey \u2013 photos from inside the camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which would be the one that made it one too many absences? Surely, the hull of England\u2019s squad could take only so many hits before it sprang a leak. Expectations were tempered. Instead of wondering how fast England\u2019s ship could sail, fans were left wondering whether it could stay afloat. Talk of a trophy became talk of how far England could go: semi-finals, quarter-finals, even last 16?</p> <p>The team\u2019s first defeat under Sarina Wiegman came shortly before the tournament, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/11/england-australia-international-friendly-match-report\" title=\"\">a 2-0 loss</a> against the World Cup co-hosts Australia in April. How would that affect morale just three months out? Would the air of invincibility fade? Would the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/18/england-pause-womens-world-cup-bonus-talks-fa-disappointed\" title=\"\">row over performance-related bonuses</a> rupture the togetherness between the players, staff and Football Association?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/22/england-haiti-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Haiti was a struggle</a>, England labouring against the World Cup debutants, but a Georgia Stanway penalty helped them over the line. Lauren James\u2019s sixth\u2011minute strike secured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/28/england-denmark-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">victory against Denmark</a> but still the team laboured. The loss of Walsh with what had appeared to be a serious knee injury felt like the nail in the coffin of any remaining title aspirations. Of all England\u2019s players, she was the irreplaceable cog. Until she wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>Wiegman and her assistant, Arjan Veurink, masterminded a change in formation that would shift England\u2019s fortunes. A back three was deployed for the final group game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/01/england-china-lauren-james-womens-world-cup-group-d-match-report\" title=\"\">against China</a>, with a double pivot of Stanway and Katie Zelem compensating for the loss of Walsh. England were thrillingly unpredictable, they seemed to have found their rhythm, but it didn\u2019t quite continue that way. Instead, the team looked a shadow of the side that delighted last year at the European Championship, that just got better and better. In a way, though, their performance on the world stage was the more impressive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c778c5ef23934627c15b5daa1ba5e68eee70f76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c778c5ef23934627c15b5daa1ba5e68eee70f76/0_362_5431_3259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarina Wiegman walks past the World Cup trophy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarina Wiegman underlined her coaching talent in Australia even though England came up short in the final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DeFodi Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/07/england-nigeria-womens-world-cup-match-report-lauren-james-red-card\" title=\"\">Nigeria stifled England</a>, Halimatu Ayinde so exceptional in her marking of James that the frustrated midfielder was handed a red card and a two-match ban for stepping on the bum of Michelle Alozie as the Nigeria player lay prone on the ground. Despite being made to work, England prevailed on penalties. Chloe Kelly\u2019s winning spot-kick was symbolic of England\u2019s run: a cool, calm, powerfully hit and confident strike that travelled faster than any goal in the Premier League last season. Then there was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/england-colombia-womens-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report\" title=\"\">fightback against Colombia</a> from a goal down and a clinical and composed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/16/england-australia-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">3-1 defeat of Australia</a> in the semi-finals to destroy the growing hopes of a nation that had woken up to women\u2019s football in style.</p> <p>They were tested, dealt harder and more complex hands and, somehow, they navigated everything thrown at them, powered by passion, trust, belief and the unrivalled skills of Wiegman and Veurink. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/20/spain-england-womens-world-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Defeat in the final</a>, going so close to the biggest of prizes, walking past the trophy, they could not touch, will hurt. But making the final in the face of so much adversity was truly impressive.</p> <p>With the winners Spain\u2019s off\u2011field trouble with their hated coach, Jorge Vilda, added into the mix, this was a final which showcased the triumph of resilience, in all its forms. The grotesque sexual assault by the<strong> </strong>Spanish football federation president, Luis Rubiales, during the presentation ceremony when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/21/luis-rubiales-kiss-outrage-spanish-football-fa-president-womens-world-cup-final-spain-jenni-hermoso\" title=\"\">planted a kiss</a> on the lips of Jenni Hermoso before being seen reaching round to kiss the cheek of the goalscorer Olga Carmona and at one point grabbing his crotch in celebration, speaks to how deeply resilient some players have had to be.</p> <p>Although Spain were superior in the final, England were a crossbar away from taking the lead, close to levelling and perhaps a misjudged substitution away strategically. The margin was narrower than Spain\u2019s domination suggested as England defended for their lives.</p> <p>What next for England? Well, there is no going backwards. Mead, Williamson and Kirby will return. James has demonstrated enough talent on the biggest of stages to make a case for the team being built around getting the best out of her. Wiegman will undoubtedly have a World Cup itch that needs scratching after her second failure in a final. Hopefully she sees England as the team with which she wants to do that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"00a7c6defbb863fb82566aaed0e9aab22e5369cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00a7c6defbb863fb82566aaed0e9aab22e5369cd/0_107_6400_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren James celebrates after scoring against China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauren James made a case at the World Cup, despite her red card, for the England team being built around her.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Cheung/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>England\u2019s future looks bright. They reached a first final against the odds; imagine what they could look like moving forward. The foundations have been laid for long-term sustained success. Far from being the end of a cycle, this is just the start. Keep Wiegman and continue along this path and the Lionesses will be challenging at the top for the next decade or more.</p> <p>Next? Olympic qualification for Team GB, then a defence of their European title. The tournaments keep rolling round.

    "content": "<p>The current status quo of smartphone design, repair and longevity could finally be upended in favour of users \u2013 and the planet. That is the message from campaign groups on the landmark overhaul of rules concerning batteries and eco-sensitive design working their way through the various legislative bodies of the European Union \u2013 a market big enough to force manufacturers to change, even if EU rules don\u2019t directly apply to other regions.</p> <p>MEPs <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230609IPR96210/making-batteries-more-sustainable-more-durable-and-better-performing\">voted </a>on 14 June to accept new battery regulations, elements of which look to ensure cells in smartphones and gadgets can be replaced with parts available for five years after the device is discontinued. In many cases, <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0237_EN.html\">the rules say</a>, batteries should be user-replaceable \u201cwithout requiring the use of specialised tools\u201d and without the heat or solvents typically required to unglue components today. Manufacturers also won\u2019t be able to use software to stop batteries installed by third parties from working.</p> <p>Despite concerns over caveats about water-resistant devices and what actually counts as user-replaceable or a specialist tool, the move was heralded as a huge step forward, with Cristina Ganapini, coordinator of the <a href=\"https://repair.eu/\">Right to Repair</a> Europe campaign, <a href=\"https://repair.eu/news/big-win-for-right-to-repair-with-new-eu-rules-for-batteries-but-legislators-must-get-the-implementation-right/\">calling it</a> \u201ca big success for the right to repair\u201d, though the regulations are not due to kick in until 2027.</p> <p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2022/0095(COD)&amp;l=en\">complementary new rules</a> on ecodesign were <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230707IPR02429/ecodesign-more-environmentally-friendly-and-energy-efficient-products\">voted through</a> that go even further to \u201cmake sustainable products the norm\u201d, with designs that are easier to repair, upgrade and recycle.</p> <p>The ecodesign proposal sets out minimum requirements for smartphones and tablets, covering protection from dust and water, resistance to accidental drops, and battery longevity. It would also ensure the supply of spare parts for at least seven years after the discontinuation of the device, plus access to the software required to ensure they work after professional repair.</p> <p>All these aspects are key to more sustainable devices championed by the right to repair movement. But they could force a change in the smartphone market that people may not expect.</p> <p>\u201cTo have truly replaceable batteries, smartphones will have to get bigger,\u201d said Francisco Jeronimo, vice-president of devices analysis at market research company IDC. \u201cWhile Apple may have the expertise and customer support network to make battery replacement in a thin design possible, smaller vendors lack that competitive advantage and will have to compromise on design.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not as obvious to the end user but software plays a big role in longevity</p> <footer> <cite>Agn\u00e8s Crepet, head of IT, Fairphone</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Indeed, the most repairable device on the market, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/15/fairphone-4-review-ethical-repairable-phone-gets-big-upgrade\">Fairphone 4</a> with its modular battery replaceable using just a <a href=\"https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406223046545-Fairphone-4-Replace-a-Spare-Part\">fingernail</a>, is significantly chunkier and more expensive than your average phone \u2013 a trade-off many will see as worthwhile.</p> <p>But just as important are the proposal\u2019s new rules for software, which seek to force manufacturers to provide updates for at least five years after the device has been discontinued.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as obvious to the end user but software plays a big role in longevity,\u201d said Agn\u00e8s Crepet, head of IT and software longevity at ethical phone company Fairphone. \u201cYou need software running on your phone to keep it longer; first, for security purposes, because if you don\u2019t have software updates on your phone then your data is at risk, but also for apps.</p> <p>\u201cWhatsApp could stop working, so could banking apps, because they are fairly strict on security patches, so if your operating system is not being updated, they could just stop working.\u201d</p> <p>The average phone receives only two to three years of updates from its initial release \u2013 not when it is bought or leaves the market. Top-end phones from big names such as Google and Samsung typically get five years of updates, with Apple often providing six or more years, which is still short of the ideals.</p> <p>\u201cEven if the hardware is perfect, if apps don\u2019t work, people will want to change it,\u201d said Crepet, who suggested forcing manufacturers to allow the use of open-source software such as <a href=\"https://lineageos.org/\">LineageOS</a> or <a href=\"https://postmarketos.org/\">PostmarketOS</a> as a solution for some users at the end of a device\u2019s official support.</p> <p>While this may be a good step forward for sustainability, as with hardware longevity, it may not result in the majority of people keeping their phones for longer even if they could. According to a consumer survey by IDC, 62% of respondents replace their phones every one to three years and only 24% of people want to keep their handsets longer. The latter group is growing, but the No 2 customer complaint after battery life is phones being too slow.</p> <p>\u201cSoftware updates require more and more of the hardware, not just in processing power but in the amount of data people generate in files and apps, which causes the phone to become slower the longer it is used,\u201d said Jeronimo. \u201cThe technology is just moving on too fast. Even if you could give people a phone that lasts seven years, they will want a new one for a new chipset to keep up with software and hardware improvements such as 4G, 5G or 6G etc.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest boost may therefore be in the second or third-hand market. A phone that still has software support holds significantly more value and can lead a longer useful life, which keeps it out of landfill and reduces the environmental burden.</p> <p>The rules won\u2019t come into force in the immediate future, as the regulations still need to be approved and have a 21-month grace period after they become law. But once they do, forcing significantly longer software support from manufacturers may also have unanticipated consequences for the phone market.</p> <p>\u201cThe cost for a small vendor of updating phone software is in the seven-figure, \u00a31m-plus range, so they will have a massive challenge to support their devices long enough,\u201d said Jeronimo. \u201cIt will put many of them out of business, particularly the small, EU-based ones, and cause consolidation in the market with a reduction in the number and variety of products, as the burden will just be too great.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sustainability guide</strong></h2> <p>If you must replace your phone today, here are the most sustainable new handsets available \u2013 or better yet, look for a refurbished model.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de8cbf5cf8fbec5552a66d88e4200fec9e9ed5a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de8cbf5cf8fbec5552a66d88e4200fec9e9ed5a4/285_269_4792_2876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image of a Nokia G22 smartphone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nokia G22 is designed to be repaired at home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Nokia G22</strong><strong>: </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_gb/nokia-g-22/buy?sku=101S0609H002\">\u00a3114</a></strong><br>The Nokia G22 is a budget Android model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/13/nokia-g22-review-a-budget-android-phone-you-can-repair-yourself\">designed to be repaired at home</a> using fairly simple tools, with replacement parts readily available from <a href=\"https://store.ifixit.co.uk/\">iFixit</a>.

    "content": "<p>Jeremy Hunt has kickstarted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/jeremy-hunt-accused-of-taking-a-20bn-gamble-on-nuclear-energy-and-carbon-capture\">a fresh push into nuclear power</a>, which he hopes will provide a quarter of Britain\u2019s electricity by 2050. In his budget speech, the chancellor announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and hopes a new delivery body, Great British Nuclear, will ease the creation of nuclear projects. He also launched a consultation to classify nuclear as \u201cenvironmentally sustainable\u201d. But is it?</p> \n<h2>Does Britain need nuclear power?</h2> \n<p>Hunt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/21/johnson-announces-aim-for-uk-to-get-25-of-energy-from-nuclear-power\">follows in the footsteps of the former prime minister Boris Johnson</a> in making bold statements on the importance of nuclear. Britain\u2019s nuclear power stations date back to the 1950s and are now ageing, with just one, Sizewell B, still scheduled to be running after 2028. Last week, France\u2019s EDF \u2013 which operates the stations \u2013 said it had <a href=\"https://www.edfenergy.com/media-centre/news-releases/edf-confirms-plans-keep-turbines-turning-heysham-1-and-hartlepool-power\">extended</a> the life of two other plants.</p> \n<p>Proponents argue that nuclear provides a \u201cbaseload\u201d of power that can be relied on, whereas renewable energy such as wind and solar is dependent on weather conditions, meaning it cannot always help match supply with demand. There are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/12/breakthrough-in-nuclear-fusion-could-mean-near-limitless-energy\">high hopes</a> for nuclear fusion as an energy source, but this has not been commercialised.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/12/gbenergymix/current\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Why is nuclear being reclassified?</h2> \n<p>To attract private investment. The consultation is on the \u201ctaxonomy\u201d or financial classification system of energy. This is important as there have been a proliferation of funds dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments springing up in global financial markets in recent years. These funds promise their investors that their cash is going towards social good, such as tackling the climate crisis. Hunt was also under pressure to respond to the Inflation Reduction Act, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/biden-signs-inflation-reduction-act-landmark-healthcare-climate-bill\">Joe Biden\u2019s $369bn climate subsidy package</a>.</p> \n<h2>Is Britain the first country to do this?</h2> \n<p>No. The European Commission decided last year to label nuclear as a \u201cgreen\u201d investment. The EU\u2019s parliament said the taxonomy change aimed \u201cto boost green investments and prevent \u2018greenwashing\u2019\u201d. However, the decision has faced legal challenges by groups including Greenpeace.</p> \n<h2>Will it make a difference?</h2> \n<p>Nuclear projects cost tens of billions of pounds to develop and build, so smoothing the path to secure investment is seen as crucial. In the UK, the government has tasked bankers with finding funders for Sizewell C, in partnership with EDF, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/25/ministers-close-to-deal-that-could-end-chinas-role-in-uk-nuclear-power-station\">easing China General Nuclear out of the project over security fears</a>. The government has committed \u00a3700m to the Suffolk plant, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/22/sizewell-c-may-cost-double-government-estimates-and-take-five-years-longer-to-build\">could cost more than \u00a330bn to build</a>. Its sister site, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been beset with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-edf-delayed-covid-costs-rise\">delays and cost overruns</a>. Senior industry sources said the taxonomy change would help in the hunt for Sizewell C\u2019s funders.</p> \n<p>The backers of small modular reactors, including a programme developed by Rolls-Royce, will also hope to receive significant investment. Rolls-Royce\u2019s\u2019 aim is to create a fleet of smaller, factory-built nuclear plants across Britain.</p> \n<h2>Is nuclear energy renewable?</h2> \n<p>Uranium, the element used in nuclear power, is a finite resource, which is mined from the ground and not considered renewable. However, it can be argued that, as nuclear power stations use a very small amount of fuel to generate the same amount of electricity, they are preferable to gas-fired power stations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/05/billionaire-investor-kretinsky-and-trader-vitol-eye-fortune-in-british-power-plant-subsidies\">which are expected to be around for many years</a>.</p> \n<h2>Is it really green?</h2> \n<p>Advocates of nuclear claim it should be seen as a green energy source as it does not release harmful emissions into the air. National Grid <a href=\"https://www.nationalgrid.com/stories/energy-explained/what-nuclear-energy-and-why-it-considered-clean-energy#:~:text=Is%20nuclear%20energy%20clean%3F,greenhouse%20gases%20through%20its%20operation\">says</a> that the \u201clifecycle emissions\u201d \u2013 emissions resulting from every stage of the production process \u2013 are also significantly lower than in fossil fuel-based generation.</p> \n<p>Hunt said on Wednesday that \u201cincreasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations\u201d. However, there are questions over how useful nuclear will realistically be in this mission. As projects take years to build \u2013 Sizewell C could be finished by the mid-2030s at a push \u2013 it can be argued that pursuing the project could prove a drain on government and financial resources, which could be better spent on rapidly scaling up Britain\u2019s wind and solar capacity and improving electricity networks and storage. An effective ban on onshore wind developments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/28/fears-grow-government-will-renege-on-lifting-onshore-windfarm-ban-in-england\">remains in place</a>.</p> \n<p>Nuclear detractors also say nuclear cannot be seen as sustainable given the concerns over the potential environmental hazards in the long term. Shutting down sites such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site\">Sellafield</a>, in north-west England, will take generations and involves a painstaking process of carefully managing ageing buildings to ensure radioactive waste is not mishandled. In Finland, a huge effort is under way to bury waste in concrete <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2021/05/31/finland-breaks-ground-on-its-deep-geologic-nuclear-waste-repository/?sh=7724a5956103\">deep underground</a>.</p> \n<p>It has also been argued that \u2013 as nuclear plants need water for cooling so are often built near the coast \u2013 rising sea levels could make some projects obsolete before building work is completed.</p> \n<h2>That is not the only concern, is it?</h2> \n<p>No. The history of the nuclear industry has shown an oscillating interest from governments and investors, influenced by a series of devastating incidents including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/mar/30/archive-three-mile-island-nuclear-accident-1979\">Three Mile Island</a> in 1979, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster\">Chornobyl</a> in 1986 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\">Fukushima</a> in 2011.

    "content": "<p>Come the third Sunday of winter, Carlton had won a mere four games. Having missed finals the previous year by a single kick deep in the shade of time-on, the Blues were additional proof of history repeating itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.</p> <p>The previous Sunday, Carlton were the footballing equivalent of chewing black rubber in a listless six-goal loss against arch rivals Essendon. The only time the Blues struck sparks that dark night was as they scraped against pre-season expectations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/04/aflw-2023-afl-womens-crowd-numbers-attendance-round-1\">Strong opening AFLW round crowd numbers credited to Matildas effect</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a loss that left most supporters entirely devoid of spirit, others riled enough to place angry calls to talkback radio, and some considering joining lesser-known Mathiesons at Florentino\u2019s over a few bottles of $350 Shiraz to figure out how to sack Michael Voss.</p> <p>A promotion for kids to get in free at the MCG when Carlton hosted the Gold Coast the following week, read more like a sting by the Department of Health and Human Services than it did a genuine AFL promotion. But this was when my daughter\u2019s journey with the Carlton Football Club began.</p> <p>I figured the crowd would be sparse and that the most virulent vitriol towards Carlton had already been spat. And despite all available evidence, it felt our best chance to, well\u2026 <em>win</em>, which makes any sell to a seven-year-old that little bit smoother.</p> <p>Of course, fandom is more than just about winning. In The ABCs of Sports Fandom, Dr. Daniel L. Wann from Murray State University in Kentucky says: \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are enriched [by sport] \u2013 there\u2019s very clear research showing that the more you identify with a local sports team, the better your social psychological health is.\u201d </p> <p>After the first quarter this sounded like fiction cut from whole cloth. Carlton started in a manner the same as it ever was \u2013 sluggish, with long pauses sagging between any play that felt coherently threatening. It hardly seemed worth the bother. My daughter looked at me as if to say \u201cyou signed me up for\u2026 <em>this</em>?\u201d</p> <p>Having sat through 10 years of <em>this</em>, I consider myself no stranger to footballing fatigue. This, however, seemed designed to try the patience of the toughest fan. But before I could explain to her that into each life of fandom some rain must fall, Carlton had changed before our very eyes. </p> <p>A goal to Charlie Curnow made it five goals in nine minutes. A further six-minute spell saw goals to Harry McKay, Tom De Koning, Matt Kennedy and Patrick Cripps, before a half-time standing ovation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"59072d30f3e864df9043d09c8310b41976db1938\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59072d30f3e864df9043d09c8310b41976db1938/0_0_5221_3533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlton and Gold Coast during the game at the MCG in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlton and Gold Coast during the game at the MCG in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a reminder \u2013 notedly a timely reminder \u2013 that sport is about moments. It doesn\u2019t matter who you support, premierships are incredibly rare. It is those moments during the year that sustain you. That Sunday, sharing the experience with my daughter for the first time, was one of those moments.</p> <p>But as pleasing as a 10-goal win was, there was nothing to suggest it was a portent for a run of moments that have sustained us through to spring \u2013 Jesse Motlop putting the Blues five goals up on Collingwood; Paddy Dow putting the crescendo on a comeback against the nemesis, St Kilda; Caleb Marchbank\u2019s left finger (right wrist, thigh\u2026 <em>whatever</em>) saving the game against Melbourne; and Curnow\u2019s mark in the dying seconds on the Gold Coast that guaranteed a September of consequence for the first time in a decade.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416279/A_review_of_the_Social_Impacts_of_Culture_and_Sport.pdf\">2015 UK report into the Social Impacts of Culture and Sport</a> found that in terms of the social capital impacts from sport, there is evidence that sport is a type of \u201csocial glue\u201d, increasing social connectedness and a sense of belonging.</p> <p>It is this sense of community and belonging that my daughter has started to experience. She can spot a Carlton bumper sticker from 50 yards, recounts parts of games to her four-year-old sister and refers to all matters Carlton as \u201cus\u201d. Even in primary school, the social connection that it can help establish demonstrates the value of sport beyond participation. </p> <p>Which isn\u2019t to say supporting Carlton for her \u2013 or for her more jaded dad \u2013 hasn\u2019t felt participatory, that the fans are disjoined from what happens from inside the boundary.</p> <p>On Saturday morning I took her to an open training session at Princes Park, which was to see proof that, in Parkville at least, sport has displaced religion as Marx\u2019s \u201copiate of the masses\u201d (although Marx, it must be said, would hardly be the Carlton Football Club\u2019s philosopher of choice).</p> <p>The two of us were part of the thousands \u2013 the Carlton commonweal \u2013 and I felt a part of September for the first time since before she was born, and she supposed that this is how it ever shall be.</p> <p>For Carlton\u2019s captain, Patrick Cripps, who will play his first final after debuting in round four of 2014, it was a reminder of when club stalwart Shane O\u2019Sullivan told him that he wouldn\u2019t understand just how big the club is until you got to finals and got rolling.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to feel that now,\u201d Cripps said on Saturday. \u201cThey [the fans] have been huge for us in the back half of the year, and we\u2019re going to need them on Friday night. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be people on the light towers, they\u2019ll be coming from everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>From what I saw on the weekend, I\u2019m comfortable enough to make a confident bet that he\u2019ll be right.</p>"

But while a full tank is a way off, the mere whiff of a guilt-free future has got airline executives giddy.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/05/airlines-on-course-record-revenues-803bn-2023-iata-willie-walsh-fares-profits\" title=\"\">annual meeting of Iata</a>, the airlines\u2019 global trade body, in Istanbul last week served up some exotic fare. Was that Willie Walsh, its director general, denouncing governments for \u201cgreenwashing\u201d? And Marjan Rintel, boss of KLM and fresh from a Dutch court battle against government caps on Schiphol flights, outlining her purpose to \u201ccreate memorable experiences on the planet we care for\u201d? And Mehmet Tevfik Nane, head of Turkish airline Pegasus, co-hosting an event for 1,500 delegates where he urged firms and states to join their climate struggle, saying \u201cwe have to take care and heal our world\u201d?</p> <p>Wider society\u2019s mix of dissociation, hope and underlying fear about climate is writ large in aviation, whose leaders are well aware of its outsized share of greenhouse gas emissions and lack of easy options to decarbonise. Meanwhile, passenger numbers are booming, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/05/ba-owner-raises-profit-forecast-as-travel-demand-rebounds-iag-covid\" title=\"\">rampant demand for travel after Covid</a>.

Replacing old fleets with modern fuel-efficient planes for less CO<sub>2</sub> a head is a step most airlines are taking \u2013 but that benefits the bottom line more than the environment when more people fly.</p> <p>So, the magic elixir is SAF \u2013 sustainable aviation fuel \u2013 which Walsh affirmed would \u201cbe the biggest contributor to net zero success\u201d. However, in broad terms right now, it \u201cbasically doesn\u2019t exist\u201d, as Iata\u2019s chief economist, Marie Owens Thomsen, put it. Airlines might be using \u201cevery single drop\u201d of SAF available, but that amounts to 0.1% of the total jet fuel needed \u2013 and supplies are impossible to find in much of the world.</p> <p>Airlines are looking at an interim target of 30bn litres a year \u2013 100 times the current supply \u2013 by 2030. The reasons for hope are a plethora of projects springing up, especially in the US; rapidly developing technology; and some government policy backing \u2013 even if Iata is uneasy about laws mandating minimum blends of SAF in jet fuel. </p> <p>In the broad category of SAFs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/05/e-fuels-cars-aviation\" title=\"\">synthetic fuels or e-fuels</a> are seen as the most credible way forward by many \u2013 involving a process that draws carbon dioxide from the air, albeit energy-intensively, rather than using sources that are limited or problematic. For example, one SAF source, or \u201cfeedstock\u201d, is animal fats. According to a report by the Brussels-based charity Transport and Environment, creating enough SAF for a transatlantic flight would require the fat of 8,800 pigs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddb0a2d99b8c0a6ed2f6fae8eb9730f32688ec46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddb0a2d99b8c0a6ed2f6fae8eb9730f32688ec46/0_0_7105_4263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marjan Rintel smiling at someone off camera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marjan Rintel, the chief executive of KLM, is focusing current efforts on fuel efficiency rather than SAFs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quite apart from the ethical concerns \u2013 the Vegan Society of Canada has warned against flying on the basis that SAFs could already be in the tank \u2013 the practicalities of the necessary feedstock, be it pigs, cooking oil, plants or waste, appear to be an enormous barrier. </p> <p>Tim Clark, the president of Emirates Airlines, asked: \u201cThere\u2019s only so many animals you can slaughter to get the oil \u2026 Where\u2019s the feedstock?\u201d For him, e-fuels are more feasible, but he warned: \u201cMoney is probably the biggest single blocker, because these are hugely expensive programmes. So I\u2019m afraid that means nuclear coming into the mix. That\u2019s not going to sit well with Greens, but in the end, I don\u2019t see how you\u2019re going to drive enough power to get your synthetic fuels and power the rest of the global economy sustainably with wind or whatever it may be.\u201d</p> <p>Iata argues that the pace of change and investment is driving rapid progress. Walsh \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/05/airlines-on-course-record-revenues-803bn-2023-iata-willie-walsh-fares-profits\" title=\"\">who lambasted</a> a recent <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/net-zero-aviation/net-zero-aviation-fuels-policy-briefing.pdf\" title=\"\">Royal Society report</a> spelling out the improbability of using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/28/scientists-uk-aviation-net-zero-ambitions-half-farmland-double-renewable-electricity\" title=\"\">current UK renewable energy capacity and feedstocks</a> \u2013 said: \u201cPeople will try to discredit it, but that\u2019s not fair. SAF is a genuine, significant contribution to a better environment. You\u2019re recycling the CO<sub>2</sub> \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s about, reducing or maintaining or not increasing the levels of CO<sub>2</sub>.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone is convinced. Caitlin Hewitt, policy director of the Aviation Environment Federation, said she would love a guilt-free plane trip \u2013 \u201cbut there is increasing scepticism about the possibility of scaling up SAFs\u201d. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s no feedstock \u2013 everything is in demand elsewhere. They work really much more like an offset.\u201d And, like offsets, some are clearly better \u2013 such as e-fuels synthesised with direct carbon capture \u2013 while the carbon neutrality claimed for others was questionable, she said: \u201cThe idea of using waste from processes such as intensive agriculture or animal fats, or plastic manufacture, that are fundamentally unsustainable \u2026 I don\u2019t think you can claim that as a sustainable carbon reduction.\u201d</p> <p>While Walsh said that airlines\u2019 commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 was \u201cfixed and firm\u201d, the flight path is less so. Emirates recently announced its own $200m (\u00a3160m) research fund, because, Clark said, \u201cwith the current pathways available, our industry won\u2019t be able to hit net zero targets in the prescribed timeline\u201d.</p> <p>Focusing on SAFs, said Clark, risked diverting the focus from progress in more efficient technology now \u2013 developments such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/28/we-cant-wait-for-hydrogen-rolls-royce-warren-east-on-the-engine-makers-future\" title=\"\">Rolls-Royce UltraFan engine</a>, which the manufacturers hope will bring another 10% fuel saving.</p> <p>Rintel, who is jettisoning her fleet\u2019s last Boeing 747 freighters for less fuel-hungry and quieter Airbus A350s, stressed efficiency was the priority for KLM, with SAFs on the future wishlist. On the promise of net zero fuels, \u201cthere must be somewhere a breakthrough,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019re more in the curve, but the question is, when will it pay out? Nobody knows.\u201d</p>"

Fishing communities and wildlife depend on this species, but continued overfishing is putting both at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Mackerel is caught by various states, including Norway, Iceland, the UK, and countries in the EU. Currently, these countries are not working together to tackle overfishing of the species, the charity said. Coombes said countries need to agree on quotas \u201cto protect stocks\u201d.</p> <p>In October 2021, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/04/brexit-overfishing-uk-waters\">main fishing states</a> again agreed that total mackerel catches in 2022 should not exceed the scientific advice (794,920 tonnes), but not how the catches should be divided. The combined catch limits set by all countries for 2022 totalled 1,131,416 tonnes, exceeding the advice by 42%.</p> <p>During March 2023, countries met to decide how to divide the next set of quotas. However, nothing was decided and talks are continuing.</p> <p>The UK takes about 17% of the total mackerel catch, mostly from Scottish boats. In 2021, more than 220,000 tonnes of mackerel were caught \u2013 32% of the total UK catch \u2013 worth about \u00a3240m.</p> <p>Mackerel is important prey for whales, dolphins, and tuna, the charity said, adding that removing too much of this species could have wider environmental effects.</p> <p>Only 15 ratings have joined the green-rated \u201cbest choice\u201d list this spring. The MCS use a traffic light system \u2013 green, red and amber \u2013 to show where fish rank, with mackerel moving to the amber list. An amber rating means that improvements are needed, in this case, better management to end overfishing of the stock.</p> <p>Despite the bad news for international fishing, mackerel caught by hand line in south-west England remains green-rated. This is a low-impact way of fishing, and catches are strictly controlled. There are also protections in place for juvenile mackerel to make sure they can reproduce before they are caught.</p> <p>Among the ratings that did not change were European eel and Celtic cod, which stay on the red-rated \u201cfish to avoid\u201d list.</p> <p>Jack Clarke, sustainable seafood advocate at the MCS, said: \u201cEel is still appearing on menus across the country, despite being more endangered than the Bengal tiger. Populations have declined by as much as 95% in the past decade and recent scientific advice couldn\u2019t be clearer \u2013 it\u2019s time to stop eating eel. It\u2019s the most trafficked animal on the planet, with an illegal eel trade estimated to be worth \u00a32.5bn every year.\u201d</p> <p>Celtic cod is often caught by boats catching haddock and whiting, as they are often found together in the marine environment.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cThe UK is working intensively with its partners to agree a range of management measures designed to improve the long-term sustainability of mackerel stock, in addition to a new quota sharing arrangement.</p> <p>\u201cWe will continue to work with those partners, in consultation with stakeholders, to establish the most effective range of measures to ensure the long-term health of the stock.\u201d</p>"

Then consider that the battery of an electric car uses 8kg of lithium, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/dec/08/the-curse-of-white-oil-electric-vehicles-dirty-secret-lithium\" title=\"\">likely extracted</a> from briny pools on South America\u2019s salt flats, a process that has been blamed for shrinking pasturelands and causing desertification.</p> <p>The 14kg of cobalt that prevent the car\u2019s battery from overheating have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/nov/08/cobalt-drc-miners-toil-for-30p-an-hour-to-fuel-electric-cars\" title=\"\">probably come</a> from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where cobalt mines have contaminated water supplies and soil. As the demand for electric vehicles grows, the mining and refining of their components will intensify, further damaging natural ecosystems.

Subsidised by governments and promoted by the automotive industry, they fit smoothly with the economic ideas that guide how policymakers think about reducing carbon emissions. According to the idea of \u201cgreen growth\u201d, whose adherents include the World Bank and the White House, so long as the right policies are in place, societies will be able to enjoy endless growth while reducing their carbon footprint. Growth, the process by which a country increases the amount of goods and services it produces, is supposed to raise people\u2019s wages and provide governments with an income that can be invested into public services such as schools and hospitals. To proponents of green growth, new innovations such as electric cars will help \u201cdecouple\u201d growth from carbon emissions and allow humans to live a life of plenty within the limits of the planet.</p> <p>That\u2019s the theory, at least. But there is little evidence that this will be possible on the timescale required. Global carbon emissions have <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021\" title=\"\">risen</a> to their highest levels in history. Recently, researchers have warned that the Earth may already be past its safe limits for humanity. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\" title=\"\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>, preventing irreversible damage to the natural environment depends on holding the world below 1.5C of warming, and climate scientists calculate that the emissions of high-income countries need to decrease at <a href=\"https://earth.stanford.edu/news/global-carbon-emissions-need-shrink-10-times-faster-0\" title=\"\">10 times</a> their current rate to achieve this. Electric cars will be essential to this, but if nations are to meet stringent emissions targets and avoid soaring electricity demand, there will need to be fewer cars on the road. The problem is that there are few templates for an economy that radically shrinks the world\u2019s carbon footprint without also shrinking our quality of life.</p> <p>The economist Kate Raworth believes she has a solution. It is possible, she argues, to design an economy that allows humans and the environment to thrive. Doing so will mean rejecting much of what defined 20th-century economics. This is the essential premise of her only book, Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st Century Economist, which became a surprise hit when it was published in 2017. The book, which has been translated into 21 languages, brings to mind a charismatic professor dispensing heterodox wisdom to a roomful of students. \u201cCitizens of 2050 are being taught an economic mindset that is rooted in the textbooks of 1950, which in turn are rooted in the theories of 1850,\u201d Raworth writes. By exposing the flaws in these old theories, such as the idea that economic growth will massively reduce<strong> </strong>inequality, or that humans are merely self-interested individuals, Raworth wants to show how our thinking has been constrained by economic concepts that are fundamentally unsuited to the great challenges of this century.</p> <p>To Raworth, the ideal economy of the future can be captured in a single image: a ring doughnut. Its outer crust represents an ecological limit, while its inner ring represents a social foundation. To step beyond the ecological limit will damage the environment beyond repair. To fall below the social foundation will mean some people go without the things they need to live well, such as food, housing or income. Her argument is that economies must be designed so they operate inside this ring, enabling humans and the environment to flourish. The doughnut is premised on three central ideas: the economy should distribute wealth fairly, regenerate the resources that it uses, and allow people to prosper. None of this, Raworth argues, should depend on economic growth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61f5f868c0368c686eca8521596566cb15b04b47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61f5f868c0368c686eca8521596566cb15b04b47/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of solar panels in Bangladesh\u2019s coastal area.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of solar panels in Bangladesh\u2019s coastal area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the hands of another writer, this could feel technical and remote, but Raworth approaches it with nimble metaphors and a chatty, playful disposition. Part of the book\u2019s appeal is its implied message that intractable problems could be resolved were they only framed differently. \u201cBy revealing old ideas that have entrapped us and replacing them with new ones to inspire us,\u201d Raworth writes, the book proposes a \u201cnew economic story\u201d. She mentions numerous pioneering experiments, such as the city of Oberlin, Ohio, which is trying to sequester more carbon than it produces, thus bringing its environmental impact within the doughnut\u2019s ecological ceiling, or Bangladesh\u2019s attempts to become the first \u201csolar-powered nation\u201d, gainfully employing women to install renewable energy systems in their villages. Raworth concedes that huge political changes, including clamping down on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/tax-havens\" title=\"\">tax havens</a>, will be necessary to keep economies within the ring of the doughnut. Her propositions feature \u201cno immediate answers for what to do next\u201d, she concedes, nor \u201cspecific policy prescriptions or institutional fixes\u201d. The book is less of a political programme than a provocation to think beyond capitalism\u2019s imperatives.</p> <p>\u201cMost things begin here. In the mind, in the mindset,\u201d Raworth told a recent audience at an event in Amsterdam, tapping her head for emphasis. To her critics, a shift in mindset is all very well and good, but it is not enough. The reason we haven\u2019t built a fairer, less destructive economy is not because of a failure to tell a better story, they argue, but because politicians bend to the will of corporations and elites, which have little interest in allowing the status quo to change. According to this view, change is not the product of new ideas so much as a political struggle to impose ideas upon the world.</p> <p>Raworth is meeting these criticisms head on. In 2019, in an attempt to make her ideas a reality, she founded the <a href=\"https://doughnuteconomics.org/\" title=\"\">Doughnut Economics Action Lab</a>, a social enterprise that helps bring communities into the doughnut\u2019s ring. It is working with local governments and communities across 70 cities, from <a href=\"https://doughnuteconomics.org/stories/149\" title=\"\">Nanaimo</a> on the west coast of Canada to <a href=\"https://doughnuteconomics.org/members/16471\" title=\"\">Ipoh</a> in Malaysia, to put the principles of doughnut economics into practice. Now, she faces the difficulty of turning a small set of experiments pioneered by well-intentioned and likeminded people into something far bigger and more transformative.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Raworth arrived at Oxford University to study <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain\" title=\"\">politics, philosophy and economics</a> in 1990, the only mention of the environment on her course was in an optional paper called Public Economics. Whereas the economists of the early 20th century tended to see their subject as a social science, many of their successors regarded themselves more like physicists, whose job was to uncover the laws that supposedly governed how the economy worked. In her first year, Raworth studied with Andrew Graham, one of the few economists at Oxford to take issue with the narrowing purview of the discipline. Graham liked to ask students questions about real economic events, such as why city centres decline, or whether the \u201cThatcher experiment\u201d had altered Britain\u2019s growth prospects. \u201cIf you want to study economising, you can throw all the maths at it that you like,\u201d Graham told me. \u201cIf you want to study economies, you have to embed yourself in the real world.\u201d</p> <p>In her second year, Raworth wrote a paper on the idea of development. \u201cIt struck me that it was the first time in my economics degree that we\u2019d discussed what success looked like,\u201d she recalled. \u201cUntil that point, it was just implicit that success was about economic growth.\u201d In the early 90s, most people without access to life\u2019s essentials lived in underdeveloped economies, and most economists agreed that growth was the best lever to improve their lives. As banks opened and businesses started investing, transport networks would emerge and education programmes would train workers to do new jobs that paid them higher wages, which governments could then tax back to pay for public services. Few considered the natural resources that all of this would consume, or that the Earth did not have the capacity to sustain endless growth.</p> <p>In 1995, after graduating from Oxford, Raworth moved to Zanzibar, an island off the coast of Tanzania, to take up a development fellowship, part of a scheme that recruited young economists to work as civil servants in poor countries. At the time, Zanzibar was being transformed by tourists, who flew there to stay in the new hotels along its beachfronts. Visitors might have imagined Zanzibar as a landscape of tropical profusion, with its coconut palms, seafood and mango trees, but its ecosystem was delicate. The longer she spent on the island, the more Raworth was bothered by the waste created by the island\u2019s booming tourist economy. Single-use plastic bags had recently been introduced, and their bright blue remnants became tangled on the beaches. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the framework to describe it, but this plastic was just arriving and arriving, and there was no system for collecting or managing it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI had this real frustration that we were praising countries for their development, and yet saying nothing about the ecological damage that was going on in order to achieve that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"36ec16d7251013c1de2af1a66e6939a9d8460cbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ec16d7251013c1de2af1a66e6939a9d8460cbc/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raworth in Oxford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raworth in Oxford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After three years in Zanzibar, Raworth moved to New York to begin work as a researcher on the UN\u2019s annual <a href=\"https://hdr.undp.org/\" title=\"\">Human Development report</a>, a project that ranked the world\u2019s nations not by their GDP but by their citizens\u2019 quality of life. While working on a report about consumption, Raworth read a book called How Much Is Enough?<em> </em>by Alan Durning, an American environmentalist. The book posed an urgent question: \u201cIs it possible for all the world\u2019s people to live comfortably without bringing on the decline of the planet\u2019s natural health?\u201d The only way to achieve this, Durning contended, was by buying less stuff \u2013 fewer fridge-freezers, tumble dryers, hair lotions and television sets. But few would be willing to accept the reduction in living standards that this would entail. \u201cI remember reading about the data \u2013 our use of plastics, our use of materials \u2013 and I was like, <em>this is what I\u2019ve been missing</em>,\u201d<em> </em>Raworth told me.</p> <p>In conversation, Raworth has a generous tendency to point towards the work of other economists and thinkers, as if showing you the cherished contents of a jewellery box. Sitting at her kitchen table in Oxford last autumn, she told me excitedly about the scientists who had first quantified how economic activity was exceeding the Earth\u2019s capacity to support it. Earlier attempts to measure this impact were constrained by the availability of data, which was limited to specific events, such as acid rain or the depletion of the ozone layer. Then, in 2009, a group of researchers in Stockholm produced <a href=\"https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html\" title=\"\">a circular diagram</a> that identified nine of the planet\u2019s life-supporting systems, from biodiversity to freshwater reserves. Each of these systems had its limits, which, if crossed, could cause irreversible damage.</p> <p>Raworth came across the diagram in 2009, buried in a colleague\u2019s PowerPoint presentation, when she was working as a researcher at Oxfam. She was living in Britain with her husband Roman Krznaric, an Australian philosopher who she\u2019d met in New York, and had just returned from maternity leave looking after their new twins. \u201cI remember sitting at my desk, and I was like, bam! This is the beginning of 21st-century economics,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt begins with this.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Last autumn, I travelled with Raworth to the south-eastern outskirts of Amsterdam. She had been invited as the honorary guest at the second annual \u201cdoughnut festival\u201d organised by a network of community groups based in the city, and I had tagged along in the hope of better understanding how her ideas might work in practice. From the vantage of the elevated metro, gabled Dutch terraces gave way to grey housing estates and the skyline gradually began to resemble any other European metropolis. Raworth was wearing a green puffer jacket to guard against the cold outside. Her uniform of dark trousers, durable shoes and block-coloured blouses is smart but muted, as if designed to strike a balance between the demands of a Ted talk and a climate protest. Necklaces are one of her few concessions to whimsy; today, she was wearing one in the shape of a sugar snap pea.</p> <p>Raworth\u2019s ideas have found a large audience in the Netherlands. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/amsterdam-doughnut-model-mend-post-coronavirus-economy\" title=\"\">April 2020</a>, Marieke van Doorninck, then Amsterdam\u2019s councillor for sustainability, announced the city would be basing its sustainability policies on Raworth\u2019s doughnut. The declaration suggested a radical departure from the status quo. The BBC released a video explaining how the Dutch were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p08hppxt/how-the-dutch-are-reshaping-their-post-pandemic-utopia\" title=\"\">reshaping their post-pandemic utopia</a>\u201d; Time magazine asked whether Amsterdam was about to <a href=\"https://time.com/5930093/amsterdam-doughnut-economics/\" title=\"\">replace capitalism</a>. Yet the changes that have happened in Amsterdam are smaller than initial coverage implied. More businesses in the city are committed to reusing materials, and more buildings are to be made out of wood. There seemed to be a tension between the grand vision of Raworth\u2019s book and the modest changes that bear its name.</p> <p>Members of Amsterdam\u2019s Green party, <em>De Groenen,</em> who I spoke with, along with members of its <a href=\"https://doughnuteconomics.org/groups-and-networks/1\" title=\"\">Doughnut Coalition</a>, a network that is trying to put Raworth\u2019s ideas into practice, shared a conviction that truly decarbonising the economy would mean not just cutting emissions but confronting inequalities of wealth and power. When I asked Van Doorninck how the doughnut differed from other sustainability policies, she explained by way of example. \u201cI love the fact that I have a shop around the corner that sells sneakers made from old plastic bottles,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut my first question should be: do I need new sneakers?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f4ec6cb1da5717fa5116890e570c301edb779e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f4ec6cb1da5717fa5116890e570c301edb779e5/0_420_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bike park in Amsterdam which offers free parking for more than 2,500 bicycles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bike park in Amsterdam which offers free parking for more than 2,500 bicycles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jochen Tack/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Van Doorninck worried that the prevailing mode of sustainability involved simply buying different things rather than confronting the economic assumptions that brought about environmental and social disaster in the first place. It is all too easy to imagine a future in which the wealthy continue to buy recycled sneakers, offset their carbon emissions and live in air-purified homes, while the poor suffer the worst effects of food scarcity and wildfires. The prospect of such a future \u2013 less carbon-intensive, according to some narrow metrics, but by no means fair \u2013 is precisely why Raworth argues we must view social and environmental problems side by side.</p> <p>Raworth\u2019s itinerary in Amsterdam was an indication of how her ideas have travelled. When she first visited the city after the publication of <em>Donuteconomie</em> in 2018,<strong> </strong>she was invited to speak at cultural venues in the city centre. Today, we were going to Gaasperdam, a low-income suburb, for the opening event of the Doughnut festival. Later, Raworth was due at a city farm; the following day she had an appointment at a shopping mall to see a recycling plant, and a meeting with an artist who made sculptures in the shape of doughnuts.</p> <p>As the metro sped across the city, I asked Raworth about whether she ever used other modes of transport. She had taken the Eurostar to Amsterdam, and when I had visited her home in Oxford a few months earlier, the parking bay outside was decorated with colourful chalk drawings \u2013 a celebration, she said, of her family no longer owning a car. Raworth doesn\u2019t fly, though she made an exception in 2021 for a family trip to Australia to see her husband\u2019s father. When she is invited to speak in places that can\u2019t be reached by train, she dials in via Zoom. \u201cThe downside of not flying and only getting trains is that, of course, you then have a very Eurocentric perspective,\u201d she acknowledged.</p> <p>When we arrived in Gaasperdam, we were met by Anne Stijkel, a community organiser and former scientist who lives and works in the area. In 2019, Stijkel came up with a plan to translate Raworth\u2019s ideas into tangible action. The first <a href=\"https://doughnuteconomics.org/tools/195\" title=\"\">Doughnut Deal</a> trained a group of women to sew curtains that helped insulate homes on a housing estate, ticking two boxes in the doughnut\u2019s social foundation by giving local people paid work and cheaper energy bills, while reducing their use of gas and bringing them closer in line with the doughnut\u2019s ecological ceiling. Today, the community was signing a pledge to create a generator that would turn waste \u2013 \u201cshit\u201d, as Stijkel repeated delightedly \u2013 into biogas.</p> <p>In the foyer of a community centre, a table had been laid with doughnut-shaped cakes baked in a vibrant shade of green. Stijkel showed us to a hall where a piece of rope was arranged in the shape of a doughnut on the floor. At its centre was a flame powered by biogas that licked the sides of a glass tube. The circle, the flame and the rope gave a ceremonial, almost pagan impression. A group of people gathered in the hall and Stijkel told them to stand in pairs in the circle, back to back, and take turns reading out cards that had been placed in front of them. Each card listed one of the categories from the inner and outer rings of the doughnut: \u201cgender equality\u201d, \u201cfood\u201d, \u201cnitrogen phosphorus loading\u201d. The purpose of the task was unclear to me, but everyone in the room seemed energised and hopeful.</p> <p>A kind of childlike excitement, along with a relentless inquisitiveness, extends to everything in Raworth\u2019s life. She asked questions of everyone she met in Amsterdam and never seemed to tire of the endless numbers of people who wanted to shake her hand, or tell her about the thesis of their PhD. This capacity to generate affection and make people feel seen belies an analytic intelligence and solitary focus. Raworth grew up in west London, and attended St Paul\u2019s Girls, a highly academic private school. Her sister, Sophie, who is now a BBC newsreader, wrote in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/apr/29/familyandrelationships.family9\" title=\"\">this newspaper</a> in 2006: \u201cAs teenagers we didn\u2019t understand each other or get on at all. Kate was painfully shy \u2026 She was very self-conscious and shut herself away, reading, playing the saxophone and doing art while I was going out to parties. I needed people more than she does. She doesn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In my conversations with economists and environmentalists who had worked with Raworth, her ideas were described as inspiring and quixotic. \u201cDoughnut Economics is a real testament to her ability to tell stories, engage people and convey economics,\u201d Tim Jackson, a sustainability economist at the University of Surrey, told me. But, Jackson continued, like any small and hopeful experiment in doing things differently, the doughnut will inevitably face larger obstacles, whether a privatised rail network so expensive that it forces people to drive cars, or a finance sector that continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels.</p> <p>Rather than speaking about political conflict and \u201cus v them\u201d, Raworth prefers to focus on \u201cwe\u201d; rather than talking about parties or elections, she talks about \u201cdesign\u201d. She eschews terms such as socialism or communism and seems to put little faith in Britain\u2019s current crop of elected politicians. This approach has drawn criticism from others in her field who see it as a sign of naivety about the way power works. In a review of her book, Branko Milanovi\u0107, an economist who researches inequality, accused Raworth of \u201c<a href=\"https://braveneweurope.com/doughnut-economics-seven-ways-to-think-like-a-21st-century-economist-by-kate-raworth\" title=\"\">we-ism</a>\u201d, of presuming that everyone on Earth shared the same objectives. This, he argued, was why she was able to make claims that were unfeasibly optimistic. While Raworth acknowledges that growth is needed in poorer countries, Milanovi\u0107 thought it implausible that people in richer countries would ever vote for low or no growth. \u201cShort of magic,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthis is not going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoughnut Economics is all about action. We\u2019re not sitting having academic debates back and forth about the meaning of words,\u201d Raworth said when I put these criticisms to her. \u201cIt\u2019s time to be propositional, and sometimes the best form of protest is to propose something new.\u201d To her supporters, the fact that no national government has adopted the doughnut as a substantive policy agenda is not an indictment of Raworth\u2019s ideas, but of our governing classes. Despite plentiful evidence that the pursuit of growth has accelerated the climate crisis, contributed to rising inequality and failed to secure decent living standards even for many people in rich countries, politicians of all varieties still treat it as a panacea.</p> <p>Like her avoidance of political labels, Raworth\u2019s own position on growth seems formulated to avoid alienating potential allies. \u201cShe is very carefully on the fence,\u201d Duncan Green, a former colleague of Raworth\u2019s at Oxfam, told me. Raworth describes herself as \u201cagnostic\u201d on growth: she holds that economies should promote human prosperity regardless of whether GDP is going up, down, or holding steady. \u201cShe agonised over using that word, agnostic, because you could have just said, \u2018Don\u2019t go for growth,\u2019\u201d Nigel Wilcockson, her editor at Penguin Books, told me. \u201cAt one end of the political spectrum, people say \u2018an economy without growth is impossible\u2019, and on the other end, people say \u2018that\u2019s fine for this set of nations that are doing well, but what about everyone else?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d006baf283a4acbb4a09131018839de85c70dac4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d006baf283a4acbb4a09131018839de85c70dac4/0_139_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deforestation in Mato Grosso, Brazil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deforestation in Mato Grosso, Brazil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the event in Gaasperdam, Raworth returned to central Amsterdam for a meeting with civil servants from Grenoble. They had travelled from the foot of the French Alps to learn how their city, which received an EU award for its green credentials in 2022, could become even greener by applying Raworth\u2019s ideas. Antoine Back, the city\u2019s deputy mayor, seemed nervous, even starstruck, to be sitting next to her. On the table in front of him was his well-thumbed copy of <em>La Th\u00e9orie du Donut, </em>which he later asked Raworth to sign. The civil servants sat around a long table and discussed doughnut economics over cups of peppermint tea. Back, a self-described \u201ceco-Marxist\u201d with a debonair haircut, told Raworth that they had mapped issues such as food poverty, air quality and car use in Grenoble, in an attempt to show how the city was failing to stay within the doughnut. \u201cWe have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\" title=\"\">entered the Anthropocene</a>,\u201d said Back with a dramatic inflection. \u201cThis won\u2019t be gentle; there will be ruptures, shocks.\u201d</p> <p>Raworth gently suggested that new, less doom-laden words and images would be needed to describe the future. Because there are so few models for a low-growth economy that do not entail returning to an era before industrialisation, it has been easy for critics to portray any attempt to shrink our ecological footprint as an assault on social progress. In the UK, one recent proposal to limit car traffic was accused of trying to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/01/06/green-extremists-reinventing-feudalism-banning-travel/\" title=\"\">reinvent feudalism</a>\u201d and return humanity to an age when people never left their villages. The ease with which those sceptical of growth are treated as heretics or hair-shirted hippies is part of the reason Raworth treads delicately, and focuses on more upbeat visions of life in a low-growth economy. \u201cThere is a phrase I really like, which is \u2018public luxury and private sufficiency\u2019,\u201d she told Back, pointing to Amsterdam\u2019s generous bike lanes and tram system as examples of the luxuries that could be part of the solution to the climate crisis.</p> <p>Over the past few years, a number of economists and academics have spoken out more forcefully against growth. Proponents of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/09/a-new-way-of-life-the-marxist-post-capitalist-green-manifesto-captivating-japan\" title=\"\">degrowth</a>\u201d, a theory which has spawned its own sphere of conferences, journals and publications, argue that the world\u2019s rich economies need to shrink, using less energy and fewer resources. To achieve this, consumption must be curtailed and wellbeing should be put ahead of profit. In rich nations, this would amount to a planned reduction of energy and resources to bring the economy back into balance with nature while reducing inequality.</p> <p>These ideas are not dissimilar to Doughnut Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s not the intellectual position I have a problem with,\u201d <a href=\"https://frompoverty.oxfam.org.uk/why-degrowth-has-out-grown-its-own-name-guest-post-by-kate-raworth/\" title=\"\">Raworth wrote</a> in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s the name.\u201d She views degrowth as a \u201csmoke bomb\u201d that confuses more than it explains, redirecting conversations about where humanity is headed down a rabbit hole of debate. On a burning planet, we do not have enough time for such endless discussions, she suggests. \u201cThere comes a time for the smoke to clear, and for a beacon to guide us all through the haze: something positive to aim for,\u201d she wrote.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The week after we met in Amsterdam, Raworth travelled to Birmingham to give a talk at a community centre about putting the doughnut into practice. We took the train with Rob Shorter, an employee at the Doughnut Economics Action Lab, and Raworth\u2019s daughter Siri, an intelligent, quiet teenager. Raworth was carrying a reusable shopping bag full of props: a hosepipe, a rolled-up piece of pipe lagging and a geodesic Hoberman ball that looked like a toy from the 1980s. She and Shorter were planning on trying out a new presentation involving blue plastic balls and tangerines. The tangerines, Shorter explained, would symbolise the living, biological materials on Earth that naturally regenerate, such as plants and fruit trees. The blue balls would stand in for the resources whose production carried an environmental cost, such as plastics and metals, which need to be repaired and recycled so they can be used again. The idea was to show how the current \u201clinear\u201d economy \u2013 which burns up resources and spits out carbon \u2013 should instead become a \u201ccircular\u201d economy, where resources are reused and nature is regenerated. Shorter suggested they could throw the tangerines on the floor to symbolise waste. Raworth wasn\u2019t so sure: \u201cThrowing balls is OK \u2013 but I don\u2019t like the idea of throwing and wasting food.\u201d</p> <p>The event in Birmingham was hosted by Civic Square, a social enterprise that works with low-income local communities and hosts coffee mornings and community festivals organised by people with enticing job titles such as Doughnut Storyteller and Dream Matter Designer. \u201cYou can\u2019t just keep shouting from the parapets, or relying on governments to legislate,\u201d Imandeep Kaur, the founder of Civic Square, told me. \u201cYou have to put people at the forefront of the story, so they can actually take part in it.\u201d In the future the enterprise intends to repurpose empty high-street spaces for the use of local communities, and to build a new public square. For now, they make do with a floating barge where visitors can read copies of Doughnut Economics over free coffee and cake; on the banks of the canal, they host regular events and a gardening club.</p> <p>We arrived at the venue, where a conference room had been decorated with hand-painted banners that quoted lines from Raworth\u2019s book: \u201cToday\u2019s economy is divisive and degenerative by default. Tomorrow\u2019s economy must be distributive and regenerative by design.\u201d The room seemed to rearrange itself as she moved through it. A beatboxing poet performed a song about the creation of a new economy, and Raworth watched intently, wearing an expression of transfixed delight. Then it was her turn to present. She pulled out the Hoberman ball, its colourful prongs scrunched in the shape of a star. The ball, she said, told a story about our \u201cdivisive\u201d economy, which concentrated value in the hands of a few. Raworth tugged at the ball and it bounced into a sphere. The audience let out a collective \u201coooh\u201d. \u201cThink of that,\u201d she said. \u201cA system that actually shares value, opportunity \u2026 and wealth with all those who create it.\u201d Then it was time for the tangerines. Raworth and Shorter handed them to the front row, who passed them backwards, until everyone\u2019s hands were empty. \u201cThis is the linear model of industrial production \u2013 the \u2018take-make-use-lose\u2019 economy,\u201d Raworth said, pausing on one of her signature phrases to let it sink in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/11/inactivists-tangling-up-the-climate-crisis-in-culture-wars-manston-airport-kent\">Meet the \u2018inactivists\u2019, tangling up the climate crisis in culture wars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raworth\u2019s critics might have found plenty to be cynical about in this scene \u2013 a crowd of adults playing with tangerines in the service of somehow transforming the economy. But the purpose of the presentation, indeed the purpose of every event I attended with Raworth, seemed less about directing participants towards a particular set of actions than expanding their field of vision. When I spoke to Antoine Back via Zoom a few months after we met in Amsterdam, he told me the absence of solutions in Raworth\u2019s work was one of its strengths. \u201cI don\u2019t use the word \u2018solution,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cIt suggests that there is a magic bullet; that technology will come along and save us.\u201d He feared that our tendency to search for irrefutable answers where there are none produces inertia, leading people to believe that it was always someone else\u2019s responsibility to solve the climate crisis.</p> <p>On the train back home from Birmingham, I thought about a conversation in Amsterdam with Ruurd Priester, one of the organisers of the city\u2019s Doughnut Coalition. \u201cStories and narratives are at the basis of everything we do,\u201d he told me. I asked him whether the popularity of Raworth\u2019s ideas stemmed from the way they licensed belief \u2013 or hope \u2013 in the possibility of an alternative to what we have now. \u201cI really like that way of putting it \u2013 a belief system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the economy. It\u2019s also about how economical thinking has started to dominate the ways you think about yourself, and what you think is even possible.\u201d </p> <p><em>On Wednesday 5 July, join Zoe Williams and a panel of leading thinkers for a livestreamed discussion on the ideas that can make our economies fairer.

Bora Bora, an island within the French territory, has put limits on arrivals to preserve its way of life. Palau, an archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean, asks visitors to <a href=\"https://palaupledge.com/\">sign a pledge</a> to act in an ecologically responsible way.</p> <p>Yet experts say a lack of monitoring to track impact, weak governance and limited resources hold Pacific tourism back from making environmental progress.

The Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO), the region\u2019s leading industry group with 21 member countries, has developed a <a href=\"https://southpacificislands.travel//wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pacific-Sustainable-Tourism-Policy-Framework.pdf\">sustainable tourism framework</a> and destination <a href=\"https://southpacificislands.travel/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pacific-Sustainable-Tourism-Destination-Standard.pdf\">standards</a>. They contain wide-ranging guidelines from reducing plastic and energy use to protecting culture. Sustainability certification schemes at a <a href=\"https://cookislands.travel/corporate/mana-tiaki-programme\">national</a> and global level are also in place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"937c7d3de7c0e4efa75d587828e10a4f59be9955\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/937c7d3de7c0e4efa75d587828e10a4f59be9955/0_0_4048_3032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Blue Lagoon in Port Vila, Vanuatu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Blue Lagoon in Port Vila, Vanuatu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mvaligursky/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in practice most of the frameworks and guidelines are not enforceable or widely monitored. Joseph Cheer, a professor of sustainable tourism and heritage at Western Sydney University in Australia, says frameworks set up \u201caspiration parameters\u201d for the industry and compliance is voluntary.</p> <p>\u201cThis is one of the biggest challenges in the Pacific,\u201d Cheer says. \u201cWhether a business decides to adhere to them is entirely up to them. There is no compulsion or penalty if you don\u2019t follow them.\u201d</p> <p>While he cautions against generalising about the region, Cheer says there is a lack of data collected on sustainability measures and a poor track record on governance in the Pacific. </p> <p>The Global Sustainable Tourism Council is a prominent organisation that sets standards and facilitates certification for destinations and businesses around the world \u2013 Singapore, J\u00e4rvs\u00f6 in Sweden and the Australian ski resort of Thredbo are among the places that have secured certification.

It was still a little early in the season, but I couldn\u2019t hold back: budding twigs of viburnum, potentilla, <a href=\"https://www.rhsplants.co.uk/plants/_/sambucus-nigra-f-porphyrophylla-eva-pbr/classid.2000004449/\">black elder</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/buddleja\">buddleja</a> were thrust into compost. Despite having gardened professionally for well over a decade, managing and maintaining gardens from green city pockets up to modest rural estates, this would be my first ever garden.</p> <p>It is a small, slim rectangle: 80 square metres of chalky, free-draining Hampshire soil \u2013 two-thirds of which is lawn \u2013 in a village fringing the <a href=\"https://www.northwessexdowns.org.uk/\">North Wessex Downs</a>. It is north-facing yet exposed, and therefore surprisingly sun baked between the equinoxes, and, to our delight, relatively free of pre-existing structures: a tiny shed, a thin strip of border, a miscellany of pots and a beer-branded barbecue \u2013 my potting bench, until it is forcibly rehomed \u2013 but otherwise a horticultural blank canvas. </p> <p>There is a strong argument for spending a full year observing a new garden before making significant adjustments. My opposing view is that gardens are for the <em>doing</em>, whatever time of year. So, in the hope of encouraging those who, like me, are endeavouring towards sustainable and affordable gardening, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done so far, and the tasks I\u2019ll be doing in the next few months. </p> <h2><strong>Multiply existing plants</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"450b338d319c8603ee054547ba8a04167dc47426\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/450b338d319c8603ee054547ba8a04167dc47426/0_20_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marjoram, a cold sensitive perennial herb or undershrub.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marjoram, a cold sensitive perennial herb or undershrub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonios Ntoumas/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, I took stock of what was already here \u2013 it is surprising just how many plants can reside within an area both small and seemingly sparse. I counted some 30 varieties, including hellebore, <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/aquilegia\">aquilegia</a> and Solomon\u2019s seal, and for every weed there was an attractive self-seeder: white-flowering <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/weeds/herb-robert\">herb Robert</a> alongside rampant bittercress; gorgeous feverfew and purple violet next to dandelion and bindweed. </p> <p>Desirable or otherwise, existing plants reveal much about a garden, from soil type to light distribution, and by multiplying those that thrive \u2013 by means of division \u2013 herbaceous perennials can be quickly bulked up as ground cover. Of those I\u2019d earmarked in summer, I\u2019m now splitting and replanting pulmonaria, marjoram and cranesbill geranium, creating fat new plants. Typically, this is best undertaken as the soil warms towards spring.</p> <h2><strong>Add a compost bin and water butt</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e6bc83d4863f51265e96e4031de9d683bf7bca3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e6bc83d4863f51265e96e4031de9d683bf7bca3/0_249_7360_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rain barrel, storing water for drier times.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rain barrel, storing water for drier times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shotshop GmbH/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If, like me, you\u2019re going to be ruthless with undesirables \u2013 and friends and family can\u2019t be persuaded into rehoming a flouncy fuchsia or redundant hydrangea \u2013 a compost bin is essential. Most council recycling centres will produce compost from your green waste, but why not make your own? In time, and when the salvage materials appear, I plan to construct a pair of wooden bins; in the meantime, <a href=\"https://getcomposting.com\">GetComposting</a> partners with local councils to provide composters ideal for small gardens like ours. Along with discarded roots and annual weeds, in goes our food waste and cardboard packaging. GetComposting also offers reasonably priced water butts which, connected to a down pipe, will collect rainwater for the heatwaves ahead.</p> <h2><strong>Make a cold frame</strong></h2> <p>The garden masterplan held loosely in my head does not currently include a greenhouse \u2013 there isn\u2019t really room. But a cold frame, in which hardy annuals and perennials can be nurtured, and cuttings protected from frost, is crucial. </p> <p>I made a makeshift frame from rigid Perspex (owing to the dismantlement of Covid-safe screens in shops, there is a surplus \u2013 ask around). By affixing a square sheet to a length of off-cut shelving sawn diagonally in half, and placing this against a sunny wall, I\u2019ve made myself a little hotbox for this year\u2019s sowings \u2013 echinacea, salvia, sweet pea and the annual bishop\u2019s flower, <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/78479/ammi-visnaga/details\">Ammi visnaga</a></em>. Seed packet expense can quickly rack up, so I\u2019ll be sowing collectedas well as shop bought, seed: campion and <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/sea-holly\">sea holly</a> from friends; and purple scabious and tall <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/teasel\">teasel</a> from a nearby hedgerow. </p> <h2><strong>Hardwood cuttings</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df2382bd84d88b00dbf6d6a9a00ebd72990af470\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df2382bd84d88b00dbf6d6a9a00ebd72990af470/0_11_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firming the soil around cuttings to help improve rooting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firming the soil around cuttings to help improve rooting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deborah Vernon/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Winter is the season for hardwood cuttings, when plants are dormant. Stems of pencil thickness (and length) taken from shrubs like dogwood, blackcurrant, <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/weigela\">weigela</a> and jasmine can be snipped below a leaf node and potted into a loamy compost, or stuck straight into the ground. With luck, new leaves will appear in spring. And cutting material is everywhere: a crafty snip of a car park syringa can prove priceless in future years.</p> <h2><strong>Rethink the lawn</strong></h2> <p>We\u2019ll retain a central section of lawn for our young children \u2013 I\u2019m not a monster! \u2013 but witnessing the grass scorch and brown last summer reinforced my resolve to significantly reduce it in favour of plantings. </p> <p>Change must occur gradually, however: bare earth is vulnerable to nutrient loss, topsoil erosion and overheating in high summer, which in turn leads to poor microbial activity. So I have removed only what I can swiftly plant up, creating two borders: one loosely productive (herbs, salads and a few vegetables), the other ornamental. Before doing so, however, I enriched the exposed soil with organic top-mulch. Rural stables and city farms are great for this (as are local tree surgeons for wood chippings); in our case, a local smallholder offered copious well-rotted horse manure in exchange for an occasional brush of the resident Shetland pony. Deal. </p> <h2><strong>Plant a tree</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ae0ff5f796113a66698709977158e9067998616\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ae0ff5f796113a66698709977158e9067998616/0_0_3073_2017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pears at a tree - close-up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I plan on training a handful of apples and pears as horizontal espaliers\u2019. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FooTToo/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Autumn-winter is the season for ordering and planting bare-root trees and shrubs (typically cheaper than potted) \u2013 seek out local fruit varieties as they\u2019ll be more suited to your plot, and reduce delivery costs. I have planted an almond. With so many fantastic domestic-scale tree options (hawthorns, amelanchiers, redbuds, cherries, to name a few) the choosing wasn\u2019t easy, but the <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/13964/prunus-dulcis/details\">almond</a> \u2013 <em>Prunus dulcis</em> \u2018Sultane\u2019 \u2013 ticked the requisite boxes: spring blossom for pollinators, multiple stems over a tall trunk, productive fruit (nuts), climate suitability and a preference for chalky (alkaline) soils. Every inch of fence is also fair game, so along with inevitable climbers (Virginia creeper, <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/4047/i-cobaea-scandens-i/details\">Cobaea scandens</a></em>, winter clematis), I plan on training a handful of apples and pears as horizontal espaliers.</p> <p>I am also planting hazels. Whether intentional or not, one of the most ingenious plantings I have ever encountered was that of a hazel beside a vegetable plot: a renewable source of pea sticks within easy reach of the sweet peas and climbing beans. Planting two improves cross pollination for fruit, so I have opted for \u2018Cosford\u2019 (decorative husks) and \u2018Purpurea\u2019 (attractive leaves) cultivars.</p>"

    "content": "<p>The Clay Retreat, as the name suggests, was conceived as a place of refuge \u2013 an exhale made of oak, polished concrete and plaster. Situated in the New Forest a few miles outside Lymington, it belongs to Emi and Oscar Peterson, and their two children, Lina, 12, and Tom, 16.</p> <p>The family fell in love with the area in 2014. \u201cWe rented a cottage here for a week in the summer \u2013 just the four of us and the dog \u2013 and we loved it. When we returned to London, we started to imagine what it would be like to have a place of our own down here.\u201d</p> <p>Two years later, a local estate agent showed Emi and Oscar around a single-storey cottage. \u201cHe described it as quirky,\u201d recalls Emi. What he meant was ramshackle and disjointed. The cottage had been haphazardly extended, with a conservatory that was either too hot or too cold and a single bathroom that was located at the wrong end of the house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff8d087ecf00903bf9aabf73b07b31f11ada5778\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff8d087ecf00903bf9aabf73b07b31f11ada5778/0_543_2835_3000/945.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We wanted to work with architects who knew the local area well\u2019: the outside, revealing the original L-shape of the cottage.\" width=\"945\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> \u2018We wanted to work with architects who knew the local area well\u2019: the outside, revealing the original L-shape of the cottage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Stephenson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The couple approached local architects, PAD studio, to help them make sense of the L-shaped floorplan. \u201cThe New Forest District Council has strict planning restrictions, so we wanted to work with architects who knew the local area,\u201d Emi explains. To their surprise, the planning authority suggested they knock the cottage down and build a new, sustainable and cohesive home on the footprint of the old. \u201cIn Japan, where I\u2019m from, building your own home isn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d says Emi. \u201cSo, while we weren\u2019t expecting to have to rebuild the whole house, we were keen and happy to take on the challenge.\u201d</p> <p>Their brief was uncomplicated. \u201cOur children were six and nine at the time, so we wanted a family-friendly home that was easy to maintain,\u201d Emi explains. \u201cAnd while the garden isn\u2019t massive, it was always full of birds, so we wanted to maintain a connection between the inside and outside space.\u201d In just two weeks, the existing building was razed to the ground. \u201cThat was quite shocking,\u201d Emi recalls. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018What have we done? We\u2019ve just bought it and now it doesn\u2019t exist!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the new layout, an open-plan, double-height kitchen, dining and living area occupies one side of the L-shape; two bedrooms, a family bathroom and en suite master bedroom occupy the other. The design quietly references Emi\u2019s Japanese heritage. Sliding pocket doors and a brick floor in the utility room form a modern interpretation of the traditional Japanese <em>genkan</em> \u2013 an entryway that demarcates the threshold between the shoes-on and shoes-off spaces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae1ffb9b1d7c400c2a21cbae3d44514ecbef0bab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae1ffb9b1d7c400c2a21cbae3d44514ecbef0bab/0_0_3543_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Movie night: the sisal balustrade and drop-down concealed projector screen over the fireplace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Movie night: the sisal balustrade and drop-down concealed projector screen over the fireplace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Stephenson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond the brick threshold, a vast concrete hearth lines one end of the room while doubling up as storage space in the utility room behind the fireplace. Notably, there is no TV. Instead, a concealed projection screen extends over the concrete room divider in the living room. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clever,\u201d says Emi. \u201cYou can really only see the screen when it gets dark, which limits the amount of TV we watch.\u201d A timber-clad mezzanine makes use of the generous ceiling height above.</p> <p>Beyond the mezzanine is an unexpectedly bright kitchen. \u201cI worried that that corner of the house would be dark,\u201d says Emi. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s not dark at all, but we went for this coral pink kitchen all the same.\u201d</p> <p>Natural materials have been used throughout to soften the polished concrete floor and tie the two areas of the home together. A bespoke balustrade is wrapped in handwoven sisal rope and the walls and ceilings are handwashed in natural clay plaster. A glazed hallway lines the entire internal boundary of the L-shape, drawing in natural light and connecting the interiors with the garden beyond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a86b348dff1ee4faf96aba4b0f149863beae7e49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a86b348dff1ee4faf96aba4b0f149863beae7e49/0_1535_2834_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"And so to bed: one of the bedrooms with useful built-in storage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">And so to bed: one of the bedrooms with useful built-in storage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Stephenson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outside, a covered, wooden walkway also references Emi\u2019s heritage. \u201cMy family home in Japan also has one.\u201d In the garden, a pond has been created next to the house. \u201cWhen Tom was younger, he would spend hours peering through a low-level window, gazing at the fish in the water.\u201d</p> <p>For the Petersons, the Clay Retreat has become a place to switch off from city life. \u201cAs soon as I come off the motorway, I start to feel relaxed,\u201d says Emi. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans here \u2013 we just come together, we walk in the forest, we cycle or go to the beach. It\u2019s special to have that time together.\u201d</p>"
